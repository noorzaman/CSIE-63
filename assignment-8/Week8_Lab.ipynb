      "CHAPTER 1\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.\n",
      "Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park,\n",
      "in the centre of their property, where, for many generations,\n",
      "they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage\n",
      "the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.\n",
      "The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived\n",
      "to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,\n",
      "had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.\n",
      "But her death, which happened ten years before his own,\n",
      "produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply\n",
      "her loss, he invited and received into his house the family\n",
      "of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor\n",
      "of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended\n",
      "to bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece,\n",
      "and their children, the old Gentleman's days were\n",
      "comfortably spent.  His attachment to them all increased.\n",
      "The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood\n",
      "to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,\n",
      "but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n",
      "comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness\n",
      "of the children added a relish to his existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one\n",
      "son: by his present lady, three daughters.  The son,\n",
      "a steady respectable young man, was amply provided\n",
      "for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\n",
      "and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.\n",
      "By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,\n",
      "he added to his wealth.  To him therefore the succession\n",
      "to the Norland estate was not so really important as to\n",
      "his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might\n",
      "arise to them from their father's inheriting that property,\n",
      "could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their\n",
      "father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;\n",
      "for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was\n",
      "also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest\n",
      "in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and\n",
      "like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment\n",
      "as pleasure.  He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,\n",
      "as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him\n",
      "on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his\n",
      "wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to\n",
      "his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old,\n",
      "it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself\n",
      "no power of providing for those who were most dear\n",
      "to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge\n",
      "on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.\n",
      "The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,\n",
      "in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland,\n",
      "had so far gained on the affections of his uncle,\n",
      "by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\n",
      "of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,\n",
      "an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,\n",
      "and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value\n",
      "of all the attention which, for years, he had received\n",
      "from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to\n",
      "be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection\n",
      "for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe;\n",
      "but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might\n",
      "reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,\n",
      "lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate\n",
      "already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.\n",
      "But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his\n",
      "only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer;\n",
      "and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,\n",
      "was all that remained for his widow and daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known,\n",
      "and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength\n",
      "and urgency which illness could command, the interest\n",
      "of his mother-in-law and sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the\n",
      "rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation\n",
      "of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do\n",
      "every thing in his power to make them comfortable.\n",
      "His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\n",
      "and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how\n",
      "much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to\n",
      "be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be\n",
      "ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;\n",
      "for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge\n",
      "of his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman,\n",
      "he might have been made still more respectable than he\n",
      "was:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he\n",
      "was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.\n",
      "But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--\n",
      "more narrow-minded and selfish.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated\n",
      "within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters\n",
      "by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.  He then\n",
      "really thought himself equal to it.  The prospect of four\n",
      "thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\n",
      "besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune,\n",
      "warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--\n",
      "\"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would\n",
      "be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make\n",
      "them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he could\n",
      "spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"--\n",
      "He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,\n",
      "and he did not repent.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her\n",
      "mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.\n",
      "No one could dispute her right to come; the house was\n",
      "her husband's from the moment of his father's decease;\n",
      "but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,\n",
      "and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only\n",
      "common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--\n",
      "but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,\n",
      "a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,\n",
      "by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source\n",
      "of immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never\n",
      "been a favourite with any of her husband's family;\n",
      "but she had had no opportunity, till the present,\n",
      "of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort\n",
      "of other people she could act when occasion required it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious\n",
      "behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her\n",
      "daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,\n",
      "she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the\n",
      "entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect\n",
      "on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all\n",
      "her three children determined her afterwards to stay,\n",
      "and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was\n",
      "so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,\n",
      "and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,\n",
      "though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,\n",
      "and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage\n",
      "of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "which must generally have led to imprudence.  She had\n",
      "an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,\n",
      "and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\n",
      "them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;\n",
      "and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's abilities were, in many respects,\n",
      "quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever;\n",
      "but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have\n",
      "no moderation.  She was generous, amiable, interesting: she\n",
      "was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between\n",
      "her and her mother was strikingly great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her\n",
      "sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued\n",
      "and cherished.  They encouraged each other now in the\n",
      "violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief\n",
      "which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,\n",
      "was sought for, was created again and again.  They gave\n",
      "themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase\n",
      "of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,\n",
      "and resolved against ever admitting consolation\n",
      "in future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still\n",
      "she could struggle, she could exert herself.  She could\n",
      "consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law\n",
      "on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;\n",
      "and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,\n",
      "and encourage her to similar forbearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,\n",
      "well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed\n",
      "a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having\n",
      "much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\n",
      "to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress\n",
      "of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded\n",
      "to the condition of visitors.  As such, however, they were\n",
      "treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband\n",
      "with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\n",
      "beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really\n",
      "pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland\n",
      "as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible\n",

      "accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "his invitation was accepted.\n",

      "A continuance in a place where everything reminded\n",

      "In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful\n",
      "than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine\n",
      "expectation of happiness which is happiness itself.\n",

      "thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy\n",
      "would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.\n",

      "\"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that\n",
      "they can want no addition at all.  They will have ten\n",

      "they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,\n",
      "they may all live very comfortably together on the interest\n",
      "of ten thousand pounds.\"\n",

      "\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether,\n",

      "and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.\n",
      "An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\n",
      "and over every year, and there is no getting rid\n",
      "of it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.\n",
      "I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;\n",
      "for my mother was clogged with the payment of three\n",
      "to old superannuated servants by my father's will,\n",
      "and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.\n",
      "Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then\n",
      "there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one\n",
      "of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned\n",
      "out to be no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.\n",
      "Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual\n",
      "claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,\n",
      "because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at\n",
      "my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.\n",
      "It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am\n",
      "sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\n",
      "all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood,\n",
      "\"to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income.\n",
      "One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own.\n",
      "To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,\n",
      "on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away\n",
      "one's independence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.\n",
      "They think themselves secure, you do no more than what\n",
      "is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  If I were you,\n",
      "whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.\n",
      "I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.\n",
      "It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,\n",
      "or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better\n",
      "that there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I\n",
      "may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance\n",
      "than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge\n",
      "their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,\n",
      "and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end\n",
      "of the year.  It will certainly be much the best way.\n",
      "A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent\n",
      "their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,\n",
      "be amply discharging my promise to my father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth,\n",
      "I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea\n",
      "of your giving them any money at all.  The assistance\n",
      "he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be\n",
      "reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking\n",
      "out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them\n",
      "to move their things, and sending them presents of fish\n",
      "and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.\n",
      "I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\n",
      "it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.\n",
      "Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively\n",
      "comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live\n",
      "on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the\n",
      "thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings\n",
      "them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,\n",
      "they will pay their mother for their board out of it.\n",
      "Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,\n",
      "and what on earth can four women want for more than\n",
      "that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will\n",
      "be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses,\n",
      "and hardly any servants; they will keep no company,\n",
      "and can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive\n",
      "how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am\n",
      "sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;\n",
      "and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think\n",
      "of it.  They will be much more able to give YOU something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you\n",
      "are perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean\n",
      "nothing more by his request to me than what you say.\n",
      "I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\n",
      "my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness\n",
      "to them as you have described.  When my mother removes\n",
      "into another house my services shall be readily given\n",
      "to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present\n",
      "of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however,\n",
      "ONE thing must be considered.  When your father and mother\n",
      "moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill\n",
      "was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,\n",
      "and is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore\n",
      "be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.\n",
      "A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would\n",
      "have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice\n",
      "as handsome as what belongs to this house.  A great\n",
      "deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY\n",
      "can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.\n",
      "Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this:\n",
      "that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention\n",
      "to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,\n",
      "he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his\n",
      "intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he\n",
      "finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,\n",
      "if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow\n",
      "and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly\n",
      "acts as his own wife pointed out.\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;\n",
      "not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every\n",
      "well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it\n",
      "produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,\n",
      "and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that\n",
      "of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,\n",
      "she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries\n",
      "for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;\n",
      "for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.\n",
      "But she could hear of no situation that at once answered\n",
      "her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence\n",
      "of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected\n",
      "several houses as too large for their income, which her\n",
      "mother would have approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the\n",
      "solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,\n",
      "which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.\n",
      "She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he\n",
      "had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters'\n",
      "sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\n",
      "persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would\n",
      "support her in affluence.  For their brother's sake, too,\n",
      "for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she\n",
      "reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,\n",
      "in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive\n",
      "behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\n",
      "their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,\n",
      "she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance,\n",
      "felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased\n",
      "by the farther knowledge of her character, which half\n",
      "a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps\n",
      "in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\n",
      "affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\n",
      "have found it impossible to have lived together so long,\n",
      "had not a particular circumstance occurred to give\n",
      "still greater eligibility, according to the opinions\n",
      "of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.\n",

      "This circumstance was a growing attachment between\n",

      "a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced\n",
      "to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment\n",

      "of his time there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from\n",
      "motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son\n",
      "of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed\n",
      "it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,\n",
      "the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.\n",
      "But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.\n",
      "It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\n",
      "that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned\n",
      "the partiality.  It was contrary to every doctrine of\n",
      "her's that difference of fortune should keep any couple\n",
      "asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;\n",
      "and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged\n",

      "opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.\n",
      "He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy\n",
      "to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice\n",
      "to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\n",
      "his behaviour gave every indication of an open,\n",
      "affectionate heart.  His understanding was good,\n",
      "and his education had given it solid improvement.\n",
      "But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition\n",
      "to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed\n",
      "to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.\n",
      "They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some\n",
      "manner or other.  His mother wished to interest him in\n",
      "political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see\n",
      "him connected with some of the great men of the day.\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,\n",
      "till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would\n",
      "have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.\n",
      "But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.\n",
      "All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet\n",
      "of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother\n",
      "who was more promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward had been staying several weeks in the house\n",
      "before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention;\n",
      "for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered\n",
      "her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw only that he\n",
      "was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.\n",
      "He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by\n",
      "ill-timed conversation.  She was first called to observe\n",
      "and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor\n",
      "chanced one day to make on the difference between him\n",

      "quietness of manner, which militated against all her\n",

      "I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems\n",
      "scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's\n",
      "drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person\n",
      "who can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of\n",
      "his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact\n",
      "he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover,\n",
      "not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters\n",
      "must be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose\n",
      "taste did not in every point coincide with my own.\n",

      "\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should\n",
      "you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has\n",
      "great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,\n",
      "and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,\n",
      "though he has not had opportunities of improving it.\n",
      "Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would\n",
      "have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment\n",
      "in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling\n",
      "to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate\n",
      "propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general\n",
      "direct him perfectly right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more\n",
      "on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor\n",
      "described as excited in him by the drawings of other\n",
      "people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,\n",
      "in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though\n",
      "smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured\n",
      "her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not\n",
      "consider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think\n",
      "I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him\n",
      "is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,\n",
      "I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would\n",
      "not wound the feelings of her sister on any account,\n",
      "and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.\n",
      "At length she replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him\n",
      "is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.\n",
      "I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter\n",
      "propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,\n",
      "as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world\n",
      "of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is\n",
      "worthy and amiable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile,\n",
      "\"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied\n",
      "with such commendation as that.  I do not perceive\n",
      "how you could express yourself more warmly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor,\n",
      "\"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him\n",
      "often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.\n",
      "The excellence of his understanding and his principles\n",
      "can be concealed only by that shyness which too often\n",
      "keeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice\n",
      "to his solid worth.  But of his minuter propensities,\n",
      "as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances\n",
      "been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have\n",
      "been at times thrown a good deal together, while you\n",
      "have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate\n",
      "principle by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him,\n",
      "have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on\n",
      "subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\n",
      "I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,\n",
      "enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,\n",
      "his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate\n",
      "and pure.  His abilities in every respect improve\n",
      "as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\n",
      "At first sight, his address is certainly not striking;\n",
      "and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the\n",
      "expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,\n",
      "and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.\n",
      "At present, I know him so well, that I think him\n",
      "really handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you,\n",
      "Marianne?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I\n",
      "do not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,\n",
      "I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do\n",
      "in his heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for\n",
      "the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.\n",
      "She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.\n",
      "She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required\n",
      "greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction\n",
      "of their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that\n",
      "what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,\n",
      "they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,\n",
      "and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain the real\n",
      "state of the case to her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think\n",
      "very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne here burst forth with indignation--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!\n",
      "worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.\n",
      "Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not help laughing.  \"Excuse me,\"\n",
      "said she; \"and be assured that I meant no offence to you,\n",
      "by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.\n",
      "Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;\n",
      "believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\n",
      "suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,\n",
      "without imprudence or folly.  But farther than this you must\n",
      "not believe.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.\n",
      "There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;\n",
      "and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder\n",
      "at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,\n",
      "by believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart\n",
      "I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.\n",
      "But there are other points to be considered besides\n",
      "his inclination.  He is very far from being independent.\n",
      "What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's\n",
      "occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have\n",
      "never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very\n",
      "much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there\n",
      "would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish\n",
      "to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or\n",
      "high rank.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination\n",
      "of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.\n",
      "\"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages\n",
      "will proceed from this delay.  I shall not lose you so soon,\n",
      "and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving\n",
      "that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\n",
      "be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.\n",
      "Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to\n",
      "learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.\n",
      "She could not consider her partiality for Edward\n",
      "in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.\n",
      "There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,\n",
      "if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost\n",
      "as unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him\n",
      "to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.\n",
      "It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind\n",
      "which frequently attended him.  A more reasonable cause\n",
      "might be found in the dependent situation which forbade\n",
      "the indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother\n",
      "neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable\n",
      "at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form\n",
      "a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views\n",
      "for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge as this,\n",
      "it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.\n",
      "She was far from depending on that result of his preference\n",
      "of her, which her mother and sister still considered\n",
      "as certain.  Nay, the longer they were together the more\n",
      "doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,\n",
      "for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\n",
      "than friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough,\n",
      "when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,\n",
      "and at the same time, (which was still more common,)\n",
      "to make her uncivil.  She took the first opportunity of\n",
      "affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to\n",
      "her so expressively of her brother's great expectations,\n",
      "of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should\n",
      "marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman\n",
      "who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could\n",
      "neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.\n",
      "She gave her an answer which marked her contempt,\n",
      "and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might\n",
      "be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,\n",
      "her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week\n",
      "to such insinuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered\n",
      "to her from the post, which contained a proposal\n",
      "particularly well timed.  It was the offer of a small house,\n",
      "on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,\n",
      "a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.\n",
      "The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written\n",
      "in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.\n",
      "He understood that she was in need of a dwelling;\n",
      "and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\n",
      "he assured her that everything should be done to it which\n",
      "she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.\n",
      "He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars\n",
      "of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to\n",
      "Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence\n",
      "she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the\n",
      "houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,\n",
      "be made comfortable to her.  He seemed really anxious to\n",
      "accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written\n",
      "in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure\n",
      "to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\n",
      "suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her\n",
      "nearer connections.  She needed no time for deliberation\n",
      "or inquiry.  Her resolution was formed as she read.\n",
      "The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from\n",
      "Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,\n",
      "would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\n",
      "possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its\n",
      "first recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland\n",
      "was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;\n",
      "it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing\n",
      "her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever\n",
      "from that beloved place would be less painful than to\n",
      "inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.\n",
      "She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment\n",
      "of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\n",
      "and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,\n",

      "On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\n",
      "her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.\n",
      "The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so\n",
      "simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,\n",
      "as to leave her no right of objection on either point;\n",
      "and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought\n",
      "any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from\n",

      "son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,\n",
      "and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were\n",
      "ready for her inhabiting it.  They heard her with surprise.\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly\n",
      "hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.\n",
      "She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going\n",

      "on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,\n",
      "which required no explanation to her, repeated,\n",
      "\"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?  So far from hence!\n",
      "And to what part of it?\"  She explained the situation.\n",

      "\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope\n",

      "in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find\n",
      "none in accommodating them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She concluded with a very kind invitation to\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;\n",

      "Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again\n",
      "how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at\n",
      "such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any\n",
      "service to her in removing her furniture.  He really felt\n",
      "conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion\n",
      "to which he had limited the performance of his promise to\n",
      "his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--\n",
      "The furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly\n",
      "consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,\n",
      "with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.  Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was\n",

      "now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed\n",
      "to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her\n",
      "eldest daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she\n",

      "The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately\n",

      "of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;\n",
      "a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\n",

      "their interest in the appearance of a country which they\n",

      "Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.\n",
      "It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich\n",

      "shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered\n",
      "with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly through\n",

      "was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former\n",
      "style of life rendered many additions to the latter\n",
      "indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;\n",

      "that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.\n",
      "\"As for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is\n",
      "too small for our family, but we will make ourselves\n",

      "in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring,\n",
      "if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\n",
      "think about building.  These parlors are both too small\n",
      "for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often\n",
      "collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the\n",
      "passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,\n",
      "and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;\n",
      "this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,\n",
      "and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\n",
      "little cottage.  I could wish the stairs were handsome.\n",

      "as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival\n",
      "seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort\n",
      "to be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much\n",
      "of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable\n",

      "to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better\n",
      "settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\n",
      "to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could\n",
      "not give offence.  His kindness was not confined to words;\n",
      "for within an hour after he left them, a large basket\n",
      "full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,\n",
      "which was followed before the end of the day by a present\n",

      "answered for him, while he hung about her and held\n",
      "down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,\n",
      "who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he\n",
      "could make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit\n",
      "a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision\n",
      "for discourse.  In the present case it took up ten minutes\n",
      "to determine whether the boy were most like his father\n",

      "the latter for that of his lady.  They were scarcely\n",
      "ever without some friends staying with them in the house,\n",

      "He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,\n",

      "was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely\n",
      "that the room would be wanted for some time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!\n",
      "But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been\n",
      "unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last\n",
      "adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening\n",
      "of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no\n",
      "distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes\n",
      "of an affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave\n",
      "them purposely together in the course of the last morning,\n",
      "and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out\n",
      "of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward,\n",
      "cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command is invariable.\n",
      "When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try\n",
      "to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied\n",
      "in it?\"\n",

      "The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable\n",
      "comfort to themselves.  The house and the garden, with all\n",
      "the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,\n",
      "and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland\n",
      "half its charms were engaged in again with far greater\n",
      "enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the\n",
      "loss of their father.  Sir John Middleton, who called\n",
      "on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was\n",
      "not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,\n",
      "could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors, except those from Barton Park,\n",
      "were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties\n",
      "that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated\n",
      "assurances of his carriage being always at their service,\n",
      "the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the\n",
      "wish of society for her children; and she was resolute\n",
      "in declining to visit any family beyond the distance\n",
      "of a walk.  There were but few who could be so classed;\n",
      "and it was not all of them that were attainable.\n",
      "About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow\n",
      "winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,\n",
      "as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their\n",
      "earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking\n",
      "mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland,\n",
      "interested their imagination and made them wish to be\n",
      "better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry,\n",
      "that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,\n",
      "was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,\n",
      "and never stirred from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.\n",
      "The high downs which invited them from almost every window\n",
      "of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air\n",
      "on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt\n",
      "of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;\n",
      "and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret\n",
      "one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the\n",
      "partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear\n",
      "the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding\n",
      "days had occasioned.  The weather was not tempting enough\n",
      "to draw the two others from their pencil and their book,\n",
      "in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would\n",
      "be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would\n",
      "be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own\n",
      "penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they\n",
      "caught in their faces the animating gales of a high\n",
      "south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented\n",
      "their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne,\n",
      "\"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least\n",
      "two hours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against\n",
      "the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about\n",
      "twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over\n",
      "their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--\n",
      "Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,\n",
      "to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.\n",
      "One consolation however remained for them, to which the\n",
      "exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;\n",
      "it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep\n",
      "side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage,\n",
      "but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;\n",
      "and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,\n",
      "was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom\n",
      "in safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers\n",
      "playing round him, was passing up the hill and within\n",
      "a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.\n",
      "He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She had\n",
      "raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been\n",
      "twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.\n",
      "The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her\n",
      "modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,\n",
      "took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried\n",
      "her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,\n",
      "the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her\n",
      "directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived,\n",
      "and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair\n",
      "in the parlour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at\n",
      "their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed\n",
      "on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration\n",
      "which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized\n",
      "for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner\n",
      "so frank and so graceful that his person, which was\n",
      "uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice\n",
      "and expression.  Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,\n",
      "the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would\n",
      "have been secured by any act of attention to her child;\n",
      "but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,\n",
      "gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness\n",
      "of address which always attended her, invited him to\n",
      "be seated.  But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.\n",
      "His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present\n",
      "home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would\n",
      "allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire\n",
      "after Miss Dashwood.  The honour was readily granted,\n",
      "and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,\n",
      "in the midst of a heavy rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness\n",
      "were instantly the theme of general admiration,\n",
      "and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne\n",
      "received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--\n",
      "Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,\n",
      "for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his\n",
      "lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding\n",
      "him after their entering the house.  But she had seen\n",
      "enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,\n",
      "and with an energy which always adorned her praise.\n",
      "His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever\n",
      "drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying\n",
      "her into the house with so little previous formality, there\n",
      "was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended\n",
      "the action to her.  Every circumstance belonging to him\n",
      "was interesting.  His name was good, his residence was in\n",
      "their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all\n",
      "manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.\n",
      "Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,\n",
      "and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval\n",
      "of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out\n",
      "of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him,\n",
      "he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman\n",
      "of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE\n",
      "in the country? That is good news however; I will\n",
      "ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here\n",
      "every year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.\n",
      "A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider\n",
      "in England.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne,\n",
      "indignantly.  \"But what are his manners on more intimate\n",
      "acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John was rather puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him\n",
      "as to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,\n",
      "and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer\n",
      "I ever saw.  Was she out with him today?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the\n",
      "colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could\n",
      "describe to her the shades of his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.  \"Where does he come\n",
      "from?  Has he a house at Allenham?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence;\n",
      "and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property\n",
      "of his own in the country; that he resided there only\n",
      "while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,\n",
      "to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\n",
      "to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth\n",
      "catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty\n",
      "little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;\n",
      "and if I were you, I would not give him up to my\n",
      "younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.\n",
      "Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.\n",
      "Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a\n",
      "good humoured smile, \"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded\n",
      "by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what\n",
      "you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which\n",
      "they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us,\n",
      "let them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however,\n",
      "from what you say, that he is a respectable young man,\n",
      "and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,\n",
      "as ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.  \"I remember\n",
      "last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced\n",
      "from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes,\n",
      "\"and with elegance, with spirit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought\n",
      "to be.  Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them\n",
      "should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see\n",
      "how it will be.  You will be setting your cap at him now,\n",
      "and never think of poor Brandon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne,\n",
      "warmly, \"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every\n",
      "common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and 'setting\n",
      "one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,' are the most\n",
      "odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal;\n",
      "and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,\n",
      "time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John did not much understand this reproof;\n",
      "but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say,\n",
      "one way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,\n",
      "and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can\n",
      "tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining\n",
      "of ankles.\"\n",

      "Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance\n",
      "than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage\n",
      "early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.\n",
      "He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;\n",
      "with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own\n",
      "gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during\n",
      "the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,\n",
      "mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family\n",
      "to whom accident had now introduced him.  Of their\n",
      "personal charms he had not required a second interview\n",
      "to be convinced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,\n",
      "regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.\n",
      "Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so\n",
      "correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height,\n",
      "was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when\n",
      "in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,\n",
      "truth was less violently outraged than usually happens.\n",
      "Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,\n",
      "her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features\n",
      "were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;\n",
      "and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,\n",
      "a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen\n",
      "without delight.  From Willoughby their expression was at\n",
      "first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance\n",
      "of his assistance created.  But when this passed away,\n",
      "when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the\n",
      "perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness\n",
      "and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\n",
      "that of music and dancing he was passionately fond,\n",
      "she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the\n",
      "largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest\n",
      "of his stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only necessary to mention any favourite\n",
      "amusement to engage her to talk.  She could not be\n",
      "silent when such points were introduced, and she\n",
      "had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.\n",
      "They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing\n",
      "and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general\n",
      "conformity of judgment in all that related to either.\n",
      "Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,\n",
      "she proceeded to question him on the subject of books;\n",
      "her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt\n",
      "upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of\n",
      "five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to\n",
      "become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,\n",
      "however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly alike.\n",
      "The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--\n",
      "or if any difference appeared, any objection arose,\n",
      "it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments\n",
      "and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.\n",
      "He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;\n",
      "and long before his visit concluded, they conversed\n",
      "with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them,\n",
      "\"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.\n",
      "You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in\n",
      "almost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks\n",
      "of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating\n",
      "their beauties as he ought, and you have received every\n",
      "assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\n",
      "But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\n",
      "extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?\n",
      "You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.\n",
      "Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments\n",
      "on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then\n",
      "you can have nothing farther to ask.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this\n",
      "just? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you mean.\n",
      "I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.\n",
      "I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;\n",
      "I have been open and sincere where I ought to have\n",
      "been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had\n",
      "I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I\n",
      "spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have\n",
      "been spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended\n",
      "with Elinor--she was only in jest.  I should scold\n",
      "her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check\n",
      "the delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--\n",
      "Marianne was softened in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his\n",
      "pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish\n",
      "of improving it could offer.  He came to them every day.\n",
      "To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the\n",
      "encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\n",
      "greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it\n",
      "had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.\n",
      "She was confined for some days to the house; but never had\n",
      "any confinement been less irksome.  Willoughby was a young\n",
      "man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,\n",
      "and open, affectionate manners.  He was exactly formed\n",
      "to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined\n",
      "not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour\n",
      "of mind which was now roused and increased by the example\n",
      "of her own, and which recommended him to her affection\n",
      "beyond every thing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.\n",
      "They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical\n",
      "talents were considerable; and he read with all the\n",
      "sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless\n",
      "as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him\n",
      "but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly\n",
      "delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on\n",
      "every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.\n",
      "In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,\n",
      "in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment\n",
      "of undivided attention where his heart was engaged,\n",
      "and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,\n",
      "he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,\n",
      "in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation\n",
      "which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever\n",
      "seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,\n",
      "had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was all\n",
      "that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour\n",
      "and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;\n",
      "and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect\n",
      "as earnest, as his abilities were strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative\n",
      "thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect\n",
      "of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and\n",
      "expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having\n",
      "gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had\n",
      "so early been discovered by his friends, now first became\n",
      "perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed\n",
      "by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn off to his\n",
      "more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other\n",
      "had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed\n",
      "when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule\n",
      "so justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,\n",
      "though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,\n",
      "were now actually excited by her sister; and that however\n",
      "a general resemblance of disposition between the parties\n",
      "might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally\n",
      "striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the\n",
      "regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;\n",
      "for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,\n",
      "when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as\n",
      "she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished\n",
      "him indifferent.  She liked him--in spite of his gravity\n",
      "and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\n",
      "His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve\n",
      "appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits\n",
      "than of any natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John\n",
      "had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,\n",
      "which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,\n",
      "and she regarded him with respect and compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more\n",
      "because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,\n",
      "who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively\n",
      "nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby\n",
      "one day, when they were talking of him together,\n",
      "\"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;\n",
      "whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\n",
      "to talk to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it\n",
      "is injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed\n",
      "by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself\n",
      "without taking pains to converse with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby,\n",
      "\"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem\n",
      "of the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would\n",
      "submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman\n",
      "as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command\n",
      "the indifference of any body else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself\n",
      "and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady\n",
      "Middleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure,\n",
      "your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,\n",
      "than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man;\n",
      "and sense will always have attractions for me.\n",
      "Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.\n",
      "He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,\n",
      "has read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him\n",
      "capable of giving me much information on various subjects;\n",
      "and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of\n",
      "good-breeding and good nature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously,\n",
      "\"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,\n",
      "and the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made\n",
      "any such inquiries, but they happened to be points\n",
      "on which I had been previously informed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may\n",
      "have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,\n",
      "and palanquins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I may venture to say that HIS observations\n",
      "have stretched much further than your candour.\n",
      "But why should you dislike him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary,\n",
      "as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word,\n",
      "and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend,\n",
      "more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats\n",
      "every year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has\n",
      "neither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding\n",
      "has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice\n",
      "no expression.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\"\n",
      "replied Elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your\n",
      "own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give\n",
      "of him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only\n",
      "pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,\n",
      "of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using\n",
      "me unkindly.  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,\n",
      "and to convince me against my will.  But it will not do.\n",
      "You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  I have\n",
      "three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;\n",
      "he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;\n",
      "he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,\n",
      "and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it\n",
      "will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,\n",
      "that I believe his character to be in other respects\n",
      "irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return\n",
      "for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,\n",
      "you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much\n",

      "when they first came into Devonshire, that so many\n",
      "engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly\n",
      "presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent\n",
      "invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\n",
      "leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.\n",
      "When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home\n",
      "and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,\n",
      "were put into execution.  The private balls at the park\n",
      "then began; and parties on the water were made and\n",
      "accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.\n",
      "In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;\n",
      "and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended\n",
      "these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing\n",
      "intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford\n",
      "him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne,\n",
      "of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\n",
      "in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance\n",
      "of her affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.\n",
      "She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once\n",
      "or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some\n",
      "self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne abhorred all\n",
      "concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;\n",
      "and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not\n",
      "in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely\n",
      "an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection\n",
      "of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.\n",
      "Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\n",
      "all times, was an illustration of their opinions.\n",

      "When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.\n",
      "Every thing he did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.\n",

      "and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,\n",
      "were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word\n",

      "Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment\n",
      "to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,\n",
      "was more likely to be softened than she had thought it\n",
      "possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed\n",

      "Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not\n",
      "so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements\n",

      "Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply\n",
      "to her the conversation she missed; although the latter\n",
      "was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded\n",
      "her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of\n",
      "her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history\n",
      "to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been\n",
      "equal to her means of improvement, she might have known\n",
      "very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of\n",
      "Mr. Jenning's last illness, and what he said to his wife\n",
      "a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton was more\n",

      "Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her\n",
      "reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense\n",

      "or give pleasure as a companion.  Willoughby was out\n",
      "of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even her\n",
      "sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;\n",
      "his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less\n",
      "agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.\n",

      "Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason\n",
      "to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already\n",

      "which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,\n",
      "when they were sitting down together by mutual consent,\n",

      "\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\n",

      "\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it\n",
      "without reflecting on the character of her own father,\n",
      "who had himself two wives, I know not.  A few years\n",
      "however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis\n",
      "of common sense and observation; and then they may be\n",

      "to the reception of more general opinions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings\n",

      "ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have\n",
      "all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;\n",
      "and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look\n",
      "forward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\n",

      "by saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections\n",
      "against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal\n",
      "in every body?  Are those who have been disappointed\n",
      "in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy\n",
      "of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,\n",
      "to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae\n",

      "\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change,\n",
      "a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;\n",

      "are obliged to give way, how frequently are they\n",
      "succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\n",
      "dangerous!  I speak from experience.  I once knew a lady\n",
      "who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,\n",
      "who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced\n",
      "change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--\n",
      "Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said\n",
      "too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\n",
      "which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head.\n",
      "The lady would probably have passed without suspicion,\n",
      "had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned\n",
      "her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was,\n",
      "it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his\n",
      "emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.\n",
      "Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, in her place,\n",
      "would not have done so little.  The whole story would\n",
      "have been speedily formed under her active imagination;\n",

      "in the world, except yourself and mama.  It is not\n",
      "time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--\n",
      "it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient\n",
      "to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\n",

      "The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,\n",
      "and they were such as to make further entreaty on his\n",
      "side impossible.  His concern however was very apparent;\n",
      "and after expressing it with earnestness, he added,\n",
      "in the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is\n",

      "they were whispering and talking together as fast as\n",
      "could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,\n",
      "and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long\n",
      "lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;\n",
      "and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;\n",
      "and put it into his pocket-book.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor\n",
      "tried to laugh too.  But the effort was painful.\n",

      "any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike\n",
      "of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted\n",

      "might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had\n",
      "formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer\n",
      "for the last ten years.  They contained a noble piece\n",
      "of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of\n",
      "the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,\n",
      "open carriages only to be employed, and every thing\n",
      "conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\n",

      "two hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.\"\n",

      "of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation.  We will\n",
      "not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies.\"\n",
      "Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\n",

      "\"Indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily\n",
      "in the general regret on so unfortunate an event;\n",
      "concluding however by observing, that as they were\n",
      "all got together, they must do something by way of\n",
      "being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,\n",
      "that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell,\n",
      "they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving\n",
      "about the country.  The carriages were then ordered;\n",
      "Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never looked\n",
      "happier than when she got into it.  He drove through\n",
      "the park very fast, and they were soon out of sight;\n",
      "and nothing more of them was seen till their return,\n",
      "which did not happen till after the return of all the rest.\n",
      "They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said\n",
      "only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes,\n",
      "while the others went on the downs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening,\n",
      "and that every body should be extremely merry all day long.\n",
      "Some more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the\n",
      "pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir\n",
      "John observed with great contentment.  Willoughby took\n",
      "his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not\n",
      "been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby,\n",
      "and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,\n",
      "\"I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.\n",
      "I know where you spent the morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily,\n",
      "\"Where, pray?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had\n",
      "been out in my curricle?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well,\n",
      "and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.--\n",
      "I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.  It is a very\n",
      "large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you\n",
      "will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much\n",
      "when I was there six years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne turned away in great confusion.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her\n",
      "resolution to know where they had been, she had actually\n",
      "made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom;\n",
      "and that she had by that method been informed that they\n",
      "had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there\n",
      "in walking about the garden and going all over the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could hardly believe this to be true,\n",
      "as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose,\n",
      "or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was\n",
      "in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired\n",
      "of her about it; and great was her surprise when she\n",
      "found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry with her\n",
      "for doubting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not\n",
      "go there, or that we did not see the house?  Is not it\n",
      "what you have often wished to do yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith\n",
      "was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can\n",
      "have a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open\n",
      "carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion.\n",
      "I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness\n",
      "of an employment does not always evince its propriety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof\n",
      "of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety\n",
      "in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at\n",
      "the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,\n",
      "and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you\n",
      "to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin\n",
      "to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are\n",
      "to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all\n",

      "I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking\n",
      "over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.\n",

      "you would not be justified in what you have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly\n",
      "gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of\n",
      "earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said\n",
      "with great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather\n",
      "ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted\n",

      "I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room\n",
      "up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,\n",
      "and with modern furniture it would be delightful.\n",
      "It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.\n",
      "On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind\n",

      "of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.\n",
      "I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be\n",
      "more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly\n",

      "with little intermission what could be the reason of it;\n",
      "was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over\n",
      "every kind of distress that could have befallen him,\n",
      "with a fixed determination that he should not escape\n",
      "them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something very melancholy must be the matter,\n",
      "I am sure,\" said she.  \"I could see it in his face.\n",
      "Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.\n",
      "The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand\n",
      "a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.\n",
      "I do think he must have been sent for about money matters,\n",
      "for what else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.\n",
      "I would give anything to know the truth of it.  Perhaps it\n",
      "is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,\n",
      "because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.\n",
      "May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,\n",
      "for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.\n",
      "I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.\n",
      "It is not so very likely he should be distressed in\n",
      "his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,\n",
      "and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.\n",
      "I wonder what it can be!  May be his sister is worse\n",
      "at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting off\n",
      "in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out\n",
      "of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into\n",
      "the bargain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion\n",
      "varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming\n",
      "equally probable as they arose.  Elinor, though she felt\n",
      "really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\n",
      "away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;\n",
      "for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion\n",
      "justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,\n",
      "her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was engrossed\n",
      "by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby\n",
      "on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly\n",
      "interesting to them all.  As this silence continued,\n",
      "every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible\n",
      "with the disposition of both.  Why they should not openly\n",
      "acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant\n",
      "behaviour to each other declared to have taken place,\n",
      "Elinor could not imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could easily conceive that marriage might not\n",
      "be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby\n",
      "was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.\n",
      "His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven\n",
      "hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income\n",
      "could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\n",
      "of his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy\n",
      "maintained by them relative to their engagement, which\n",
      "in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;\n",
      "and it was so wholly contradictory to their general\n",
      "opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\n",
      "her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt\n",
      "was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be more expressive of attachment\n",
      "to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.  To Marianne\n",
      "it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's\n",
      "heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the\n",
      "affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The cottage\n",
      "seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;\n",
      "many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;\n",
      "and if no general engagement collected them at the park,\n",
      "the exercise which called him out in the morning was\n",
      "almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day\n",
      "was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\n",
      "favourite pointer at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening in particular, about a week after\n",
      "Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed\n",
      "more than usually open to every feeling of attachment\n",
      "to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's\n",
      "happening to mention her design of improving the cottage\n",
      "in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration\n",
      "of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!\n",
      "No. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must\n",
      "be added to its walls, not an inch to its size,\n",
      "if my feelings are regarded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "\"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother\n",
      "will never have money enough to attempt it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.  \"May she\n",
      "always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I\n",
      "would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment\n",
      "of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements\n",
      "in the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed\n",
      "sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,\n",
      "I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose\n",
      "of it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really\n",
      "so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am,\" said he.  \"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,\n",
      "I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness\n",
      "is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull\n",
      "Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this\n",
      "cottage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,\n",
      "I suppose,\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all\n",
      "and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience\n",
      "or INconvenience about it, should the least variation\n",
      "be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I\n",
      "might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under\n",
      "the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,\n",
      "you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you\n",
      "now do this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby,\n",
      "\"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will\n",
      "always have one claim of my affection, which no other can\n",
      "possibly share.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,\n",
      "whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,\n",
      "as plainly denoted how well she understood him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at\n",
      "Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were\n",
      "inhabited!  I never passed within view of it without admiring\n",
      "its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.\n",
      "How little did I then think that the very first news\n",
      "I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into\n",
      "the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I\n",
      "felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,\n",
      "which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I\n",
      "should experience from it, can account for.  Must it not have\n",
      "been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered voice.\n",
      "Then continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this\n",
      "house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it\n",
      "of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear\n",
      "parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which\n",
      "so many happy hours have been since spent by us together,\n",
      "you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\n",
      "and every body would be eager to pass through the room\n",
      "which has hitherto contained within itself more real\n",
      "accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of\n",
      "the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration\n",
      "of the kind should be attempted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied.\n",
      "\"Your promise makes me easy.  Extend it a little farther,\n",
      "and it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your\n",
      "house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find\n",
      "you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you\n",
      "will always consider me with the kindness which has made\n",
      "everything belonging to you so dear to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's\n",
      "behaviour during the whole of the evening declared\n",
      "at once his affection and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "when he was leaving them.  \"I do not ask you to come in\n",
      "the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady\n",
      "Middleton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place\n",
      "the next day, and two of her daughters went with her;\n",
      "but Marianne excused herself from being of the party,\n",
      "under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,\n",
      "who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby\n",
      "the night before of calling on her while they were absent,\n",
      "was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "On their return from the park they found Willoughby's\n",
      "curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,\n",
      "and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture\n",
      "had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;\n",
      "but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight\n",
      "had taught her to expect.  They were no sooner in the\n",
      "passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour\n",
      "apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief\n",
      "at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\n",
      "Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room\n",
      "she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,\n",
      "who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back\n",
      "towards them.  He turned round on their coming in,\n",
      "and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook\n",
      "of the emotion which over-powered Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "as she entered--\"is she ill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful;\n",
      "and with a forced smile presently added, \"It is I who may\n",
      "rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a\n",
      "very heavy disappointment!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Disappointment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.\n",
      "Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege\n",
      "of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on\n",
      "business to London.  I have just received my dispatches,\n",
      "and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration\n",
      "I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Almost this moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must\n",
      "be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from\n",
      "us long I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I\n",
      "have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.\n",
      "My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within\n",
      "the twelvemonth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only\n",
      "house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?\n",
      "For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed\n",
      "on the ground he only replied, \"You are too good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.\n",
      "Elinor felt equal amazement.  For a few moments every one\n",
      "was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at\n",
      "Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not\n",
      "press you to return here immediately, because you only\n",
      "can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;\n",
      "and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question\n",
      "your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby,\n",
      "confusedly, \"are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter\n",
      "myself\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished\n",
      "to speak, and another pause succeeded.  This was broken\n",
      "by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly\n",
      "to linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself\n",
      "any longer by remaining among friends whose society\n",
      "it is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then hastily took leave of them all and left\n",
      "the room.  They saw him step into his carriage,\n",
      "and in a minute it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly\n",
      "quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern\n",
      "and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.\n",
      "She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.\n",
      "Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his\n",
      "embarrassment,\n",
      "and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his\n",
      "unwillingness\n",
      "to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a\n",
      "lover,\n",
      "so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared\n",
      "that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the\n",
      "next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him\n",
      "and\n",
      "her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room\n",
      "was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,\n",
      "though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was,\n",
      "a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whatever might be the particulars of their separation,\n",
      "her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought\n",
      "with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow\n",
      "which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving\n",
      "way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about half an hour her mother returned, and though\n",
      "her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\"\n",
      "said she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart\n",
      "does he travel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It\n",
      "seems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was\n",
      "with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  And now,\n",
      "after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending\n",
      "to return!--Something more than what be owned to us must\n",
      "have happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave\n",
      "like himself.  YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.\n",
      "What can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else should he\n",
      "have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could\n",
      "plainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.\n",
      "I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can\n",
      "perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed\n",
      "strange to me as well as to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you, indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most\n",
      "satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt\n",
      "where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you\n",
      "shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded\n",
      "that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\n",
      "disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views\n",
      "for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--\n",
      "and that the business which she sends him off to transact\n",
      "is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what I\n",
      "believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she\n",
      "DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore\n",
      "at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,\n",
      "and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,\n",
      "to give into her schemes, and absent himself from\n",
      "Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,\n",
      "that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen\n",
      "to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method\n",
      "of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.\n",
      "And now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not\n",
      "have happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your\n",
      "feelings!  You had rather take evil upon credit than good.\n",
      "You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt\n",
      "for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.\n",
      "You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took\n",
      "leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour\n",
      "has shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,\n",
      "or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are\n",
      "no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they\n",
      "are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we\n",
      "have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world\n",
      "to think ill of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable\n",
      "in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  And,\n",
      "after all, what is it you suspect him of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of\n",
      "something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence\n",
      "of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.\n",
      "There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged\n",
      "of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it\n",
      "is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.\n",
      "Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient\n",
      "reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\n",
      "But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge\n",
      "them at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I\n",
      "cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from\n",
      "his character, where the deviation is necessary.\n",
      "But you really do admit the justice of what I have said\n",
      "in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their\n",
      "engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--\n",
      "and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient\n",
      "for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.\n",
      "But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse\n",
      "Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange\n",

      "spoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne\n",
      "and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,\n",
      "declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,\n",
      "and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest\n",

      "they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance\n",
      "except ONE is in favour of their engagement;\n",
      "but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,\n",
      "and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed\n",
      "of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,\n",
      "you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.\n",
      "Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister\n",
      "all this time?  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"\n",

      "\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never\n",
      "considered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts,\n",
      "I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they\n",
      "may soon be entirely done away.  If we find they correspond,\n",
      "every fear of mine will be removed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see\n",

      "Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;\n",
      "no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open\n",
      "and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.\n",

      "It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.\n",
      "I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his\n",
      "manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,\n",
      "and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.\n",
      "But all this may be explained by such a situation of his\n",

      "my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;\n",
      "and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,\n",
      "to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet\n",
      "aware that by declining your invitation, by saying\n",
      "that he was going away for some time, he should seem\n",
      "to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,\n",
      "be might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case,\n",
      "a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been\n",
      "more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent\n",
      "with his general character;--but I will not raise objections\n",
      "against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation,\n",
      "as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from\n",
      "what I may think right and consistent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does\n",
      "not deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not known\n",
      "him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;\n",
      "and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  Had he been\n",
      "in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\n",
      "it might have been odd that he should leave us without\n",
      "acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.\n",
      "It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,\n",
      "for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;\n",

      "\n",
      "They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time,\n",
      "when she entered the room and took her place at the table\n",
      "without saying a word.  Her eyes were red and swollen;\n",
      "and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained\n",
      "with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all,\n",
      "could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her\n",
      "mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,\n",
      "her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst\n",
      "into tears and left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "This violent oppression of spirits continued the\n",
      "whole evening.  She was without any power, because she\n",
      "was without any desire of command over herself.\n",
      "The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby\n",
      "overpowered her in an instant; and though her family\n",
      "were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was\n",
      "impossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear\n",
      "of every subject which her feelings connected with him.\n",

      "\n",
      "Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable\n",
      "had she been able to sleep at all the first night\n",
      "after parting from Willoughby.  She would have been\n",
      "ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,\n",
      "had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose\n",
      "than when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which\n",
      "made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger\n",
      "of incurring it.  She was awake the whole night, and she\n",
      "wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a headache,\n",
      "was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\n",
      "giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,\n",
      "and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.\n",
      "Her sensibility was potent enough!\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was over she walked out by herself,\n",
      "and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the\n",
      "recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present\n",
      "reverse for the chief of the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.\n",
      "She played over every favourite song that she had been used\n",
      "to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices\n",
      "had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing\n",
      "on every line of music that he had written out for her,\n",
      "till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness\n",
      "could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every\n",
      "day applied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte\n",
      "alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally\n",
      "suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in music,\n",
      "she courted the misery which a contrast between the past\n",
      "and present was certain of giving.  She read nothing\n",
      "but what they had been used to read together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported\n",
      "for ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;\n",
      "but these employments, to which she daily recurred,\n",
      "her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced\n",
      "occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected\n",
      "by Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again\n",
      "became uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations\n",
      "whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John\n",
      "fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them\n",
      "to it.  We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,\n",
      "and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if\n",
      "their correspondence were to pass through Sir John's hands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried\n",
      "to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.\n",
      "But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in\n",
      "her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state\n",
      "of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,\n",
      "that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she,\n",
      "\"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you,\n",
      "her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question\n",
      "could not give offence.  It would be the natural result\n",
      "of your affection for her.  She used to be all unreserve,\n",
      "and to you more especially.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would not ask such a question for the world.\n",
      "Supposing it possible that they are not engaged,\n",
      "what distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  At any\n",
      "rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve\n",
      "her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession\n",
      "of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.\n",
      "I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me,\n",
      "and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made\n",
      "known,\n",
      "when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.\n",
      "I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;\n",
      "of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent\n",
      "the denial which her wishes might direct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,\n",
      "considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther,\n",
      "but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,\n",
      "were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was several days before Willoughby's name\n",
      "was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;\n",
      "Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;\n",
      "their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--\n",
      "but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a\n",
      "volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear\n",
      "Willoughby went away before we could get through it.\n",
      "We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may\n",
      "be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"No--nor many weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;\n",
      "but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply\n",
      "from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby\n",
      "and knowledge of his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, about a week after his leaving the country,\n",
      "Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their\n",
      "usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.\n",
      "Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in\n",
      "her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\n",
      "she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked\n",
      "of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,\n",
      "and could never be found when the others set off.\n",
      "But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,\n",
      "who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.  They walked\n",
      "along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\n",
      "for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,\n",
      "satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.\n",
      "Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,\n",
      "though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long\n",
      "stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming\n",
      "to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\n",
      "they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\n",
      "which formed the distance of their view from the cottage,\n",
      "from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any\n",
      "of their walks before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered\n",
      "an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.\n",
      "In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;\n",
      "and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\"--and was\n",
      "hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is\n",
      "not Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,\n",
      "and has not his air.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.\n",
      "His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,\n",
      "to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost\n",
      "certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her\n",
      "pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within\n",
      "thirty yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again;\n",
      "her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,\n",
      "she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters\n",
      "were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known\n",
      "as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop,\n",
      "and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\n",
      "Edward Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the only person in the world who could\n",
      "at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;\n",
      "the only one who could have gained a smile from her;\n",
      "but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her\n",
      "sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant,\n",
      "walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely\n",
      "coming to visit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,\n",
      "but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of\n",
      "regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.\n",
      "To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister\n",
      "was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she\n",
      "had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.\n",
      "On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\n",
      "of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.\n",
      "He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure\n",
      "in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,\n",
      "said little but what was forced from him by questions,\n",
      "and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.\n",
      "Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.\n",
      "She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,\n",
      "as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her\n",
      "thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast\n",
      "sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short silence which succeeded the first\n",
      "surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked\n",
      "Edward if he came directly from London.  No, he had\n",
      "been in Devonshire a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being\n",
      "so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing\n",
      "her before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked rather distressed as he added, that he\n",
      "had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks\n",
      "much as it always does at this time of the year.\n",
      "The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation\n",
      "have I formerly seen them fall!  How have I delighted,\n",
      "as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me\n",
      "by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season, the air\n",
      "altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.\n",
      "They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,\n",
      "and driven as much as possible from the sight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your\n",
      "passion for dead leaves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often\n",
      "understood.  But SOMETIMES they are.\"--As she said this,\n",
      "she sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing\n",
      "herself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she, calling his attention\n",
      "to the prospect, \"here is Barton valley.  Look up to it,\n",
      "and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!\n",
      "Did you ever see their equals?  To the left is Barton park,\n",
      "amongst those woods and plantations.  You may see the end\n",
      "of the house.  And there, beneath that farthest hill,\n",
      "which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these\n",

      "\n",
      "\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the\n",
      "objects before me, I see a very dirty lane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the\n",
      "Middletons pleasant people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not\n",
      "be more unfortunately situated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can\n",
      "you be so unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars;\n",
      "and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you\n",
      "forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many\n",
      "painful moments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor took no notice of this; and directing\n",
      "her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support\n",
      "something like discourse with him, by talking of their\n",
      "present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him\n",
      "occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve\n",
      "mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;\n",
      "but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past\n",
      "rather than the present, she avoided every appearance\n",
      "of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she\n",

      "seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,\n",
      "of all things the most natural.  Her joy and expression\n",
      "of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received the kindest\n",
      "welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\n",
      "stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him\n",
      "before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome\n",
      "by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man\n",
      "could not very well be in love with either of her daughters,\n",

      "perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be\n",
      "in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne.  \"What have\n",
      "wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth\n",
      "has much to do with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only\n",
      "give happiness where there is nothing else to give it.\n",
      "Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,\n",
      "as far as mere self is concerned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come\n",
      "to the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth\n",
      "are very much alike, I dare say; and without them,\n",
      "as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\n",
      "kind of external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas\n",
      "are only more noble than mine.  Come, what is your competence?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;\n",
      "not more than THAT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor laughed.  \"TWO thousand a year! ONE is my\n",
      "wealth! I guessed how it would end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\"\n",
      "said Marianne.  \"A family cannot well be maintained on\n",
      "a smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.\n",
      "A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,\n",
      "and hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing\n",
      "so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward--\"but why must you have\n",
      "hunters?  Every body does not hunt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"\n",

      "\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought,\n",
      "\"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes\n",
      "sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing\n",
      "with the delight of such imaginary happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\"\n",
      "said Elinor, \"in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be!\n",
      "I wonder what I should do with it!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family\n",
      "to London,\" said Edward, \"in such an event!  What a happy\n",
      "day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!  You,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every\n",
      "new print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne,\n",
      "I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough\n",
      "in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\n",
      "Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she\n",
      "would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their\n",
      "falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every\n",
      "book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.\n",
      "Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very saucy.\n",
      "But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our\n",
      "old disputes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it\n",
      "be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you\n",
      "will never offend me by talking of former times.\n",
      "You are very right in supposing how my money would be\n",
      "spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly\n",
      "be employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out\n",
      "in annuities on the authors or their heirs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do\n",
      "with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that\n",
      "person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,\n",
      "that no one can ever be in love more than once in their\n",
      "life--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.\n",
      "It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me.\n",
      "You are not very gay yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh.\n",
      "\"But gaiety never was a part of MY character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's,\" said Elinor;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\"\n",
      "said Elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some\n",
      "point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,\n",
      "or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can\n",
      "hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.\n",
      "Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne,\n",
      "\"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.\n",
      "I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient\n",
      "to those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine,\n",
      "I am sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed\n",
      "at the subjection of the understanding.  All I have\n",
      "ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.\n",
      "You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,\n",
      "of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance\n",
      "in general with greater attention; but when have I advised\n",
      "you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your\n",

      "\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor,\n",
      "looking expressively at Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side\n",
      "of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much\n",
      "more on your sister's.  I never wish to offend, but I\n",
      "am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent,\n",
      "when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.\n",
      "I have frequently thought that I must have been intended\n",

      "\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\"\n",
      "replied Edward.  \"Shyness is only the effect of a sense\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits\n",
      "of her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very\n",
      "partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it\n",
      "appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was unhappy;\n",
      "she wished it were equally evident that he still\n",
      "distinguished her by the same affection which once\n",
      "she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the\n",
      "continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;\n",
      "and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\n",
      "one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room\n",
      "the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,\n",
      "who was always eager to promote their happiness as far\n",
      "as she could, soon left them to themselves.  But before she\n",
      "was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,\n",
      "turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\"\n",

      "                    ***\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward returned to them with fresh admiration\n",
      "of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,\n",
      "he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;\n",
      "and the village itself, in a much higher situation than\n",
      "the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had\n",
      "exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured\n",
      "Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe\n",
      "her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more\n",
      "minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,\n",
      "when Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not\n",
      "enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge\n",
      "in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\n",
      "and want of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call\n",
      "hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange\n",
      "and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;\n",
      "and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\n",
      "indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\n",
      "You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can\n",
      "honestly give.  I call it a very fine country--the\n",
      "hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\n",
      "and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich\n",
      "meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here\n",
      "and there.  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,\n",
      "because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it\n",
      "is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can\n",
      "easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,\n",
      "grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\n",
      "I know nothing of the picturesque.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne;\n",
      "\"but why should you boast of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind\n",
      "of affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he\n",
      "believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties\n",
      "of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with\n",
      "such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less\n",
      "discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.\n",
      "He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration\n",
      "of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.\n",
      "Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with\n",
      "the taste and elegance of him who first defined what\n",
      "picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind,\n",
      "and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,\n",
      "because I could find no language to describe them\n",
      "in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel\n",
      "all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess\n",
      "to feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me\n",
      "to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,\n",
      "but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked,\n",
      "twisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they\n",
      "are tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined,\n",
      "tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles,\n",
      "or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug\n",
      "farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,\n",
      "happy villages please me better than the finest banditti\n",
      "in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne looked with amazement at Edward,\n",
      "with compassion at her sister.  Elinor only laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne\n",
      "remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly\n",
      "engaged her attention.  She was sitting by Edward, and\n",
      "in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed\n",
      "so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\n",
      "of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried.\n",
      "\"Is that Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give\n",
      "you some.  But I should have thought her hair had been darker.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--\n",
      "but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own\n",
      "vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed\n",
      "by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary\n",
      "glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister's hair.\n",
      "The setting always casts a different shade on it,\n",
      "you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.\n",
      "That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as\n",
      "well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their\n",
      "conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free\n",
      "gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been\n",
      "procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\n",
      "She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,\n",
      "and affecting to take no notice of what passed,\n",
      "by instantly talking of something else, she internally\n",
      "resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing\n",
      "the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,\n",
      "that it was exactly the shade of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it\n",
      "ended in an absence of mind still more settled.\n",
      "He was particularly grave the whole morning.\n",
      "Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said;\n",
      "but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,\n",
      "had she known how little offence it had given her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir\n",
      "John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival\n",
      "of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey\n",
      "of the guest.  With the assistance of his mother-in-law,\n",
      "Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of\n",

      "of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but\n",
      "the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have\n",
      "prevented from being immediately sprung.  But, as it was,\n",
      "she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far\n",
      "their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either\n",

      "for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards\n",

      "to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne's countenance\n",
      "was more communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend,\n",
      "not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's\n",
      "expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their\n",

      "to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,\n",

      "to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at\n",
      "the height.  His spirits, during the last two or three days,\n",

      "Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite\n",
      "of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint\n",
      "on his time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this\n",
      "way of acting to his mother's account; and it was\n",
      "happy for her that he had a mother whose character\n",
      "was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general\n",
      "excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.\n",
      "Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes\n",
      "displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,\n",
      "she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions\n",
      "with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\n",
      "which had been rather more painfully extorted from her,\n",
      "for Willoughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits,\n",
      "of openness, and of consistency, were most usually\n",
      "attributed to his want of independence, and his better\n",
      "knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.\n",
      "The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\n",
      "in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,\n",
      "the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.\n",
      "The old well-established grievance of duty against will,\n",
      "parent against child, was the cause of all.  She would have\n",
      "been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,\n",
      "this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would\n",
      "be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.\n",
      "But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort\n",
      "to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection,\n",
      "to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word\n",
      "which fell from him while at Barton, and above all\n",
      "to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore\n",
      "round his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were\n",
      "at breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man\n",
      "if you had any profession to engage your time and give\n",
      "an interest to your plans and actions.  Some inconvenience\n",
      "to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you\n",
      "would not be able to give them so much of your time.\n",
      "But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited\n",
      "in one particular at least--you would know where to go\n",
      "when you left them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long\n",
      "thought on this point, as you think now.  It has been,\n",
      "and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune\n",
      "to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,\n",
      "no profession to give me employment, or afford me any\n",
      "thing like independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety,\n",
      "and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,\n",
      "an idle, helpless being.  We never could agree in our\n",
      "choice of a profession.  I always preferred the church,\n",
      "as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.\n",
      "They recommended the army.  That was a great deal\n",
      "too smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel\n",
      "enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,\n",
      "made a very good appearance in the first circles,\n",
      "and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had\n",
      "no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse\n",
      "study of it, which my family approved.  As for the navy,\n",
      "it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the\n",
      "subject was first started to enter it--and, at length,\n",
      "as there was no necessity for my having any profession\n",
      "at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without\n",
      "a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced\n",
      "on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,\n",
      "and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\n",
      "bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\n",
      "friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford\n",
      "and have been properly idle ever since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted\n",
      "your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up\n",
      "to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\n",
      "as Columella's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent,\n",
      "\"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling,\n",
      "in action, in condition, in every thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate\n",
      "want of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour,\n",
      "and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.\n",
      "But remember that the pain of parting from friends\n",
      "will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\n",
      "education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want\n",
      "nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,\n",
      "call it hope.  Your mother will secure to you, in time,\n",
      "that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,\n",
      "and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to\n",
      "prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\n",
      "How much may not a few months do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many\n",
      "months to produce any good to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This desponding turn of mind, though it could not\n",
      "be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain\n",
      "to them all in the parting, which shortly took place,\n",
      "and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's\n",
      "feelings especially, which required some trouble and time\n",
      "to subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,\n",
      "and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than\n",
      "what all her family suffered on his going away, she did\n",
      "not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,\n",
      "on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,\n",
      "by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means\n",
      "were as different as their objects, and equally suited\n",
      "to the advancement of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he\n",
      "was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,\n",
      "neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,\n",
      "appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the\n",
      "general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,\n",
      "she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\n",
      "from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters\n",
      "were spared much solicitude on her account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse\n",
      "of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,\n",
      "than her own had seemed faulty to her.  The business\n",
      "of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\n",
      "affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could\n",
      "have no merit.  That her sister's affections WERE calm,\n",
      "she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;\n",
      "and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,\n",
      "by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite\n",
      "of this mortifying conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without shutting herself up from her family,\n",
      "or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,\n",
      "or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,\n",
      "Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\n",
      "to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every\n",
      "possible variety which the different state of her spirits\n",
      "at different times could produce,--with tenderness,\n",
      "pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  There were moments\n",
      "in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother\n",
      "and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\n",
      "conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect\n",
      "of solitude was produced.  Her mind was inevitably\n",
      "at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;\n",
      "and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,\n",
      "must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\n",
      "her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her\n",
      "drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after\n",
      "Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company.\n",
      "She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the\n",
      "little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front\n",
      "of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw\n",
      "a large party walking up to the door.  Amongst them\n",
      "were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were\n",
      "quite unknown to her.  She was sitting near the window,\n",
      "and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest\n",
      "of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,\n",
      "and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the\n",
      "casement to speak to him, though the space was so short\n",
      "between the door and the window, as to make it hardly\n",
      "possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.\n",
      "How do you like them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush! they will hear you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.\n",
      "Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her\n",
      "if you look this way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple\n",
      "of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged\n",
      "to be excused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we\n",
      "are come? I see her instrument is open.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is walking, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not\n",
      "patience enough to wait till the door was opened before\n",
      "she told HER story.  She came hallooing to the window,\n",
      "\"How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs. Dashwood do?\n",
      "And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you\n",
      "will be glad of a little company to sit with you.\n",
      "I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.\n",
      "Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I thought I heard\n",
      "a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\n",
      "but it never entered my head that it could be them.\n",
      "I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel\n",
      "Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think\n",
      "I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come\n",
      "back again\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle\n",
      "of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady\n",
      "Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they\n",
      "all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "continued her story as she walked through the passage\n",
      "into the parlour, attended by Sir John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady\n",
      "Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.\n",
      "She was short and plump, had a very pretty face,\n",
      "and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\n",
      "possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant\n",
      "as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing.\n",
      "She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,\n",
      "except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.\n",
      "Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six\n",
      "and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than\n",
      "his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.\n",
      "He entered the room with a look of self-consequence,\n",
      "slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,\n",
      "and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,\n",
      "took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it\n",
      "as long as he staid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed\n",
      "by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,\n",
      "was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour\n",
      "and every thing in it burst forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never\n",
      "saw anything so charming!  Only think, Mamma, how it\n",
      "is improved since I was here last! I always thought it\n",
      "such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\n",
      "but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister,\n",
      "how delightful every thing is! How I should like such\n",
      "a house for myself!  Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise\n",
      "his eyes from the newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing;\n",
      "\"he never does sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had\n",
      "never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,\n",
      "and could not help looking with surprise at them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud\n",
      "as she could, and continued her account of their surprise,\n",
      "the evening before, on seeing their friends, without\n",
      "ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer laughed\n",
      "heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,\n",
      "and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it\n",
      "had been quite an agreeable surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\"\n",
      "added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,\n",
      "and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard\n",
      "by no one else, though they were seated on different sides\n",
      "of the room; \"but, however, I can't help wishing they had\n",
      "not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey\n",
      "of it, for they came all round by London upon account\n",
      "of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and\n",
      "pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.\n",
      "I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,\n",
      "but she would come with us; she longed so much to see\n",
      "you all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her\n",
      "any harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She expects to be confined in February,\"\n",
      "continued Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation,\n",
      "and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there\n",
      "was any news in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John.  \"Now, Palmer,\n",
      "you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,\n",
      "and ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her,\n",
      "as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;\n",
      "and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,\n",
      "as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up\n",
      "on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,\n",
      "and then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye\n",
      "was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.\n",
      "She got up to examine them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!\n",
      "Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;\n",
      "I could look at them for ever.\" And then sitting down again,\n",
      "she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer\n",
      "rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself\n",
      "and looked at them all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made her no answer; and only observed, after again\n",
      "examining the room, that it was very low pitched,\n",
      "and that the ceiling was crooked.  He then made his bow,\n",
      "and departed with the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John had been very urgent with them all to\n",
      "spend the next day at the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did\n",
      "not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined\n",
      "at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\n",
      "her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no\n",
      "curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,\n",
      "and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.\n",
      "They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;\n",
      "the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.\n",
      "But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should\n",
      "be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too,\n",
      "though she did not press their mother, pressed them.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all\n",
      "seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young\n",
      "ladies were obliged to yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they\n",
      "were gone.  \"The rent of this cottage is said to be low;\n",
      "but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine\n",
      "at the park whenever any one is staying either with them,\n",
      "or with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\"\n",
      "said Elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by\n",
      "those which we received from them a few weeks ago.\n",
      "The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown\n",

      "As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park\n",
      "the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at\n",
      "the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.\n",
      "She took them all most affectionately by the hand,\n",
      "and expressed great delight in seeing them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself\n",
      "between Elinor and Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was\n",
      "afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,\n",
      "as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons\n",
      "come to us next week you know.  It was quite a sudden thing\n",
      "our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage\n",
      "was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\n",
      "would go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never\n",
      "tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;\n",
      "however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,\n",
      "\"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.  I could\n",
      "get the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,\n",
      "in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I am sure\n",
      "I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till\n",

      "\n",
      "Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing\n",
      "to the ladies, began complaining of the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How horrid all this is!\" said he.  \"Such weather\n",
      "makes every thing and every body disgusting.  Dullness\n",
      "is as much produced within doors as without, by rain.\n",
      "It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  What the\n",

      "Not above ten miles, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, well! there is not much difference.\n",
      "I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet\n",
      "pretty place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Palmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her\n",
      "countenance betrayed her interest in what was said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it very ugly?\" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it\n",
      "must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John\n",
      "observed with regret that they were only eight all together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking\n",
      "that we should be so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts\n",
      "to come to us today?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me\n",
      "about it before, that it could not be done?  They dined\n",
      "with us last.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "\"should not stand upon such ceremony.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife\n",
      "with her usual laugh.  \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling\n",
      "your mother ill-bred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured\n",
      "old lady, \"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot\n",
      "give her back again.  So there I have the whip hand of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her\n",
      "husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,\n",
      "she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must\n",
      "live together.  It was impossible for any one to be more\n",
      "thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy\n",
      "than Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence,\n",
      "and discontent of her husband gave her no pain;\n",
      "and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper,\n",
      "to Elinor.  \"He is always out of humour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation,\n",
      "to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly\n",
      "ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.\n",
      "His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,\n",
      "like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\n",
      "bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\n",
      "woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too\n",
      "common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--\n",
      "It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,\n",
      "which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,\n",
      "and his general abuse of every thing before him.\n",
      "It was the desire of appearing superior to other people.\n",
      "The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,\n",
      "however they might succeed by establishing his superiority\n",
      "in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him\n",
      "except his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards,\n",
      "\"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.\n",
      "Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this\n",
      "Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are\n",
      "with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!  It will\n",
      "be quite delightful!--My love,\" applying to her husband,\n",
      "\"don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"I came\n",
      "into Devonshire with no other view.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer\n",
      "expects you; so you cannot refuse to come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you\n",
      "will like it of all things.  The Westons will be with us,\n",
      "and it will be quite delightful.  You cannot think\n",
      "what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,\n",
      "for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\n",
      "against the election; and so many people came to dine\n",
      "with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!  But,\n",
      "poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced\n",
      "to make every body like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she\n",
      "assented to the hardship of such an obligation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he\n",
      "is in Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!  It will\n",
      "be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him\n",
      "with an M.P.--But do you know, he says, he will never frank\n",
      "for me?  He declares he won't.  Don't you, Mr. Palmer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued--\n",
      "\"he says it is quite shocking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational.\n",
      "Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always\n",
      "the way with him!  Sometimes he won't speak to me for half\n",
      "a day together, and then he comes out with something\n",
      "so droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She surprised Elinor very much as they returned\n",
      "into the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did\n",
      "not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would,\n",
      "he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased\n",
      "with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't\n",
      "think how disappointed he will be if you don't come\n",
      "to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object\n",
      "to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;\n",
      "and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.\n",
      "She thought it probable that as they lived in the\n",
      "same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some\n",
      "more particular account of Willoughby's general\n",
      "character, than could be gathered from the Middletons'\n",
      "partial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain\n",
      "from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might\n",
      "remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began\n",
      "by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,\n",
      "and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\"\n",
      "replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not that I ever spoke\n",
      "to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.\n",
      "Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton\n",
      "while he was at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--\n",
      "but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.  However, I dare say\n",
      "we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,\n",
      "if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never\n",
      "have been in the country together.  He is very little\n",
      "at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,\n",
      "I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is\n",
      "in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a\n",
      "way off.  I know why you inquire about him, very well;\n",
      "your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it,\n",
      "for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much\n",
      "more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason\n",
      "to expect such a match.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is\n",
      "what every body talks of.  I assure you I heard of it\n",
      "in my way through town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon\n",
      "Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town,\n",
      "and he told me of it directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell\n",
      "you of it!  Surely you must be mistaken.  To give such\n",
      "intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,\n",
      "even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel\n",
      "Brandon to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that,\n",
      "and I will tell you how it happened.  When we met him,\n",
      "he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking\n",
      "of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,\n",
      "and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family\n",
      "come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word\n",
      "they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be\n",
      "married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.  Is it true,\n",
      "pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in\n",
      "Devonshire so lately.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what did the Colonel say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he\n",
      "knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down\n",
      "as certain.  It will be quite delightful, I declare!\n",
      "When is it to take place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,\n",
      "he did nothing but say fine things of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems\n",
      "an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it\n",
      "is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.\n",
      "Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--\n",
      "I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he\n",
      "hardly ever falls in love with any body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part\n",
      "of Somersetshire?\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe\n",
      "many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna\n",
      "is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable\n",
      "I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.\n",
      "She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;\n",
      "not but that he is much more lucky in getting her,\n",
      "because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing\n",
      "can be good enough for her.  However, I don't think\n",
      "her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;\n",
      "for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does\n",
      "Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him\n",
      "to own it last night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby\n",
      "was not very material; but any testimony in his favour,\n",
      "however small, was pleasing to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\"\n",
      "continued Charlotte.--\"And now I hope we shall always be\n",
      "great friends.  You can't think how much I longed to see you!\n",
      "It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!\n",
      "Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I am so glad\n",
      "your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will\n",
      "be a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place,\n",
      "by all accounts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "have not you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.--\n",
      "He was a particular friend of Sir John's. I believe,\"\n",
      "she added in a low voice, \"he would have been very\n",
      "glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John and Lady\n",
      "Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think\n",
      "the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would\n",
      "have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been\n",
      "married immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal\n",
      "to your mother before it was made?  Had he never owned\n",
      "his affection to yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it,\n",
      "I dare say he would have liked it of all things.\n",
      "He had not seen me then above twice, for it was before\n",
      "I left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.\n",
      "Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 21\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day,\n",
      "and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain\n",
      "each other.  But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly\n",
      "got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done\n",
      "wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause,\n",
      "at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities,\n",
      "and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between\n",
      "husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some\n",
      "other new acquaintance to see and observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with\n",
      "two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction\n",
      "of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough\n",
      "for Sir John to invite them directly to the park,\n",
      "as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.\n",
      "Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before\n",
      "such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into\n",
      "no little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing\n",
      "that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls\n",
      "whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--\n",
      "whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;\n",
      "for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject\n",
      "went for nothing at all.  Their being her relations too\n",
      "made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts\n",
      "at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,\n",
      "when she advised her daughter not to care about their being\n",
      "so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\n",
      "up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to\n",
      "prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the\n",
      "idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,\n",
      "contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle\n",
      "reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by\n",
      "no means ungenteel or unfashionable.  Their dress was\n",
      "very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted\n",
      "with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\n",
      "and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children\n",
      "that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their\n",
      "favour before they had been an hour at the Park.\n",
      "She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,\n",
      "which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.\n",
      "Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this\n",
      "animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage\n",
      "to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival,\n",
      "and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\n",
      "in the world.  From such commendation as this, however,\n",
      "there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew\n",
      "that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met\n",
      "with in every part of England, under every possible\n",
      "variation of form, face, temper and understanding.\n",
      "Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly\n",
      "and look at his guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It\n",
      "was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I\n",
      "declare you shall come--You can't think how you will\n",
      "like them.  Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured\n",
      "and agreeable!  The children are all hanging about her already,\n",
      "as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they both long\n",
      "to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter\n",
      "that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;\n",
      "and I have told them it is all very true, and a great\n",
      "deal more.  You will be delighted with them I am sure.\n",
      "They have brought the whole coach full of playthings\n",
      "for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?\n",
      "Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.\n",
      "YOU are my cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must\n",
      "be related.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain\n",
      "a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two,\n",
      "and then left them in amazement at their indifference,\n",
      "to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the\n",
      "Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss\n",
      "Steeles to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When their promised visit to the Park and consequent\n",
      "introduction to these young ladies took place, they found\n",
      "in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,\n",
      "with a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;\n",
      "but in the other, who was not more than two or three\n",
      "and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\n",
      "features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,\n",
      "and a smartness of air, which though it did not give\n",
      "actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--\n",
      "Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\n",
      "allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she\n",
      "saw with what constant and judicious attention they\n",
      "were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton.\n",
      "With her children they were in continual raptures,\n",
      "extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\n",
      "their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from\n",
      "the importunate demands which this politeness made on it,\n",
      "was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,\n",
      "if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns\n",
      "of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance\n",
      "the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\n",
      "Fortunately for those who pay their court through\n",
      "such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise\n",
      "for her children, the most rapacious of human beings,\n",
      "is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;\n",
      "but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\n",
      "affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards\n",
      "her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton\n",
      "without the smallest surprise or distrust.  She saw with\n",
      "maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments\n",
      "and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\n",
      "She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about\n",
      "their ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives\n",
      "and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being\n",
      "a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other surprise\n",
      "than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\n",
      "without claiming a share in what was passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his\n",
      "taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing\n",
      "it out of window--\"He is full of monkey tricks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently\n",
      "pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed,\n",
      "\"How playful William is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added,\n",
      "tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,\n",
      "who had not made a noise for the last two minutes;\n",
      "\"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there\n",
      "such a quiet little thing!\"\n",

      "simple and just, came in without any eclat.  She merely\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And what a charming little family they have!  I\n",
      "never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I\n",
      "quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always\n",
      "distractedly fond of children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile,\n",
      "\"from what I have witnessed this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little\n",
      "Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the\n",
      "outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton;\n",
      "and for my part, I love to see children full of life\n",
      "and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?  I suppose\n",
      "you were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In some surprise at the familiarity of this question,\n",
      "or at least of the manner in which it was spoken,\n",
      "Elinor replied that she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\"\n",
      "added Miss Steele.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I\n",
      "suppose you have not so many in this part of the world;\n",
      "for my part, I think they are a vast addition always.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed\n",
      "of her sister, \"that there are not as many genteel young\n",
      "men in Devonshire as Sussex?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there\n",
      "an't.  I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter;\n",
      "but you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there\n",
      "might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not\n",
      "so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies\n",
      "may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without\n",
      "them as with them.  For my part, I think they are vastly\n",
      "agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.\n",
      "But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.  Now there's\n",
      "Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\n",
      "quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you\n",
      "do but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.--\n",
      "I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "before he married, as he was so rich?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you,\n",
      "for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.\n",
      "But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before\n",
      "he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest\n",
      "alteration in him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being\n",
      "beaux--they have something else to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of\n",
      "nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you\n",
      "think of nothing else.\" And then to turn the discourse,\n",
      "she began admiring the house and the furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.\n",
      "The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left\n",
      "her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded\n",
      "by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest,\n",
      "to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left\n",
      "the house without any wish of knowing them better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well\n",
      "provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton,\n",
      "his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly\n",
      "proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they\n",
      "declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished,\n",
      "and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\n",
      "they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.--\n",
      "And to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found\n",
      "was their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely\n",
      "on the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be\n",
      "too strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy\n",
      "must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour\n",
      "or two together in the same room almost every day.\n",
      "Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any\n",
      "more was required: to be together was, in his opinion,\n",
      "to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\n",
      "meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\n",
      "established friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do him justice, he did every thing in his power\n",
      "to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles\n",
      "acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins'\n",
      "situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor\n",
      "had not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of\n",
      "them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky\n",
      "as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she\n",
      "came to Barton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young\n",
      "to be sure,\" said she, \"and I hear he is quite a beau,\n",
      "and prodigious handsome.  And I hope you may have as good\n",
      "luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend\n",
      "in the corner already.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more\n",
      "nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward,\n",
      "than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was\n",
      "rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat\n",
      "newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit,\n",
      "they had never dined together without his drinking to her\n",
      "best affections with so much significancy and so many nods\n",
      "and winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--\n",
      "had been likewise invariably brought forward, and found\n",
      "productive of such countless jokes, that its character\n",
      "as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long\n",
      "established with Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the\n",
      "benefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they\n",
      "raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman\n",
      "alluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed,\n",
      "was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\n",
      "into the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not\n",
      "sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,\n",
      "for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name,\n",
      "as Miss Steele had in hearing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His name is Ferrars,\" said he, in a very audible whisper;\n",
      "\"but pray do not tell it, for it's a great secret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ferrars!\" repeated Miss Steele; \"Mr. Ferrars is\n",
      "the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law's brother,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;\n",
      "I know him very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you say so, Anne?\" cried Lucy, who generally\n",
      "made an amendment to all her sister's assertions.\n",
      "\"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, it\n",
      "is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.\n",
      "\"And who was this uncle?  Where did he live?  How came\n",
      "they acquainted?\"  She wished very much to have the subject\n",
      "continued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself;\n",
      "but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time\n",
      "in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either\n",
      "in curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition\n",
      "to communicate it.  The manner in which Miss Steele had\n",
      "spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck\n",
      "her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion\n",
      "of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something\n",
      "to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing,\n",
      "for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by\n",
      "Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir\n",
      "John.\n",

      "Marianne, who had never much toleration for any\n",
      "thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,\n",
      "or even difference of taste from herself, was at\n",
      "this time particularly ill-disposed, from the state\n",
      "of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles,\n",
      "or to encourage their advances; and to the invariable\n",
      "coldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every\n",
      "endeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally\n",
      "attributed that preference of herself which soon became\n",
      "evident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy,\n",
      "who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation,\n",
      "or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy\n",
      "and frank communication of her sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often\n",
      "just and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour\n",
      "Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers\n",
      "had received no aid from education: she was ignorant\n",
      "and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,\n",
      "her want of information in the most common particulars,\n",
      "could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her\n",
      "constant endeavour to appear to advantage.  Elinor saw,\n",
      "and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education\n",
      "might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less\n",
      "tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\n",
      "of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,\n",
      "her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;\n",
      "and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company\n",
      "of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;\n",
      "whose want of instruction prevented their meeting\n",
      "in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct\n",
      "toward others made every shew of attention and deference\n",
      "towards herself perfectly valueless.\n",

      "\"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\"\n",

      "personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother,\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor DID think the question a very odd one,\n",
      "and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she\n",
      "had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I\n",
      "thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.\n",
      "Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman\n",
      "she is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real\n",
      "opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous\n",
      "of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--\n",
      "\"I know nothing of her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring\n",
      "about her in such a way,\" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively\n",
      "as she spoke; \"but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish\n",
      "I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice\n",
      "of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on\n",
      "for a few minutes in silence.  It was broken by Lucy,\n",
      "who renewed the subject again by saying, with some\n",
      "hesitation,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.\n",
      "I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be\n",
      "thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth\n",
      "having as yours.  And I am sure I should not have the smallest\n",
      "fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your\n",
      "advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation\n",
      "as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.\n",
      "I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry I do NOT,\" said Elinor, in great astonishment,\n",
      "\"if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.\n",
      "But really I never understood that you were at all connected\n",
      "with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised,\n",
      "I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all\n",
      "wonder at it.  But if I dared tell you all, you would not be\n",
      "so much surprised.  Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me\n",
      "at present--but the time MAY come--how soon it will come\n",
      "must depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately\n",
      "connected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,\n",
      "with only one side glance at her companion to observe its\n",
      "effect on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean?\n",
      "Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?\"\n",

      "a sister-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I\n",

      "\"to his eldest brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,\n",
      "that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not\n",
      "an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.\n",
      "She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine\n",
      "the reason or object of such a declaration; and though\n",
      "her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,\n",
      "and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy;\n",
      "\"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;\n",
      "for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it\n",
      "to you or any of your family; because it was always meant\n",
      "to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully\n",
      "kept so by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations\n",
      "know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned\n",
      "it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence\n",
      "in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my\n",
      "behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.\n",
      "And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,\n",
      "when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has\n",
      "the highest opinion in the world of all your family,\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor for a few moments remained silent.\n",
      "Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too\n",
      "great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,\n",

      "\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion\n",
      "of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple,\n",
      "near Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun,\n",

      "and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till\n",
      "a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost\n",
      "always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter\n",
      "into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and\n",
      "approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved\n",
      "him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--\n",
      "Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is\n",
      "very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what\n",
      "she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added,\n",
      "with revived security of Edward's honour and love,\n",
      "and her companion's falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\n",
      "Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at\n",
      "what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;\n",
      "but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.\n",
      "We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling.  \"Mr. Edward\n",
      "Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,\n",
      "and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
      "is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely\n",
      "to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness\n",
      "depends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity,\n",
      "\"that I should never have heard him even mention your name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.\n",
      "Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.--\n",
      "You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,\n",
      "there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name\n",
      "to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his\n",
      "sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough\n",
      "for his not mentioning it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her\n",
      "self-command did not sink with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she\n",
      "with a firm voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have\n",
      "to wait.  Poor Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\"\n",
      "Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,\n",
      "\"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look\n",
      "at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be sure,\n",
      "but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person\n",
      "it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor\n",
      "saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a\n",
      "too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood\n",
      "might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of\n",
      "its being Edward's face.  She returned it almost instantly,\n",
      "acknowledging the likeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give\n",
      "him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at,\n",
      "for he has been always so anxious to get it!  But I am\n",
      "determined to set for it the very first opportunity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly.\n",
      "They then proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world\n",
      "of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must\n",
      "know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach\n",
      "his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.\n",
      "I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\n",
      "proud woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor;\n",
      "\"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I\n",
      "may be depended on.  Your secret is safe with me;\n",
      "but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary\n",
      "a communication.  You must at least have felt that my\n",
      "being acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,\n",
      "hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the\n",
      "falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;\n",
      "but Lucy's countenance suffered no change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great\n",
      "liberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.\n",
      "I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,\n",
      "but I have known you and all your family by description\n",
      "a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if\n",
      "you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case,\n",
      "I really thought some explanation was due to you after my\n",
      "making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother;\n",
      "and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose\n",
      "advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that knows of it,\n",
      "and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great\n",
      "deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her\n",
      "betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,\n",
      "as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest\n",
      "fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was\n",
      "mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.\n",
      "You can't think how much I go through in my mind from\n",
      "it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what\n",
      "I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.\n",
      "Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing\n",
      "him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.\n",
      "I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did\n",
      "not feel very compassionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes.\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes,\n",
      "\"I think whether it would not be better for us both\n",
      "to break off the matter entirely.\"  As she said this,\n",
      "she looked directly at her companion.  \"But then\n",
      "at other times I have not resolution enough for it.--\n",
      "I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,\n",
      "as I know the very mention of such a thing would do.\n",
      "And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don't\n",
      "think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise\n",
      "me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you\n",
      "do yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question;\n",
      "\"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.\n",
      "Your own judgment must direct you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes\n",
      "silence on both sides, \"his mother must provide for him\n",
      "sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!\n",
      "Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at\n",
      "Barton?  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,\n",
      "to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.\n",
      "Did you think he came directly from town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of\n",
      "every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity;\n",
      "\"I remember he told us, that he had been staying\n",
      "a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"\n",
      "She remembered too, her own surprise at the time,\n",
      "at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,\n",
      "at his total silence with respect even to their names.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\"\n",
      "repeated Lucy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you\n",
      "should suspect what was the matter; but it made him\n",
      "so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a\n",
      "fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--\n",
      "Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;\n",
      "for he writes in wretched spirits.  I heard from him just\n",
      "before I left Exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket\n",
      "and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.\n",
      "\"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;\n",
      "but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,\n",
      "I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full\n",
      "as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt\n",
      "no longer.  This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,\n",
      "might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have\n",
      "been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them\n",
      "by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,\n",
      "could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she\n",
      "was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could\n",
      "hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;\n",
      "and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression\n",
      "of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for\n",
      "the time complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the\n",
      "letter into her pocket, \"is the only comfort we have\n",
      "in such long separations.  Yes, I have one other comfort\n",
      "in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.\n",
      "If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.\n",
      "I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at\n",
      "Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,\n",
      "but not equal to a picture.  Perhaps you might notice\n",
      "the ring when you saw him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice,\n",
      "under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond\n",
      "any thing she had ever felt before.  She was mortified,\n",
      "shocked, confounded.\n",
      "\n",

      "to Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might\n",
      "once have been, she could not believe it such at present.\n",

      "in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been\n",
      "conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not\n",
      "an illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.\n",
      "What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!  How much\n",

      "highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first\n",
      "felt her influence over him to be more than it ought\n",

      "with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,\n",
      "be satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,\n",

      "The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally\n",

      "while the same period of time, spent on her side\n",
      "in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,\n",

      "\n",
      "From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew\n",
      "she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and\n",
      "sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command\n",
      "would neither receive encouragement from their example\n",
      "nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone,\n",

      "\n",
      "Much as she had suffered from her first conversation\n",
      "with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish\n",
      "of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.\n",
      "She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement\n",

      "what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any\n",
      "sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,\n",
      "and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her\n",
      "readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness\n",
      "in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested\n",
      "in it than as a friend, which she very much feared\n",
      "her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,\n",
      "must have left at least doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed\n",
      "to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain\n",
      "that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,\n",
      "not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing\n",
      "to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,\n",
      "with a secret so confessedly and evidently important.\n",
      "And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had\n",
      "some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor remained so well\n",
      "assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,\n",
      "it required no other consideration of probabilities\n",
      "to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;\n",
      "and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.\n",
      "What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could\n",
      "there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's\n",
      "superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him\n",
      "in future?  She had little difficulty in understanding thus\n",
      "much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly\n",
      "resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and\n",
      "honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward\n",
      "and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\n",
      "herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy\n",
      "that her heart was unwounded.  And as she could now have\n",
      "nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already\n",
      "been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going\n",
      "through a repetition of particulars with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not immediately that an opportunity\n",
      "of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well\n",
      "disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;\n",
      "for the weather was not often fine enough to allow\n",
      "of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily\n",
      "separate themselves from the others; and though they\n",
      "met at least every other evening either at the park\n",
      "or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could\n",
      "not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.\n",
      "Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady\n",
      "Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure\n",
      "was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for\n",
      "particular discourse.  They met for the sake of eating,\n",
      "drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,\n",
      "or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One or two meetings of this kind had taken place,\n",
      "without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy\n",
      "in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,\n",
      "to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all\n",
      "dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged\n",
      "to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be\n",
      "quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.\n",
      "Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she\n",
      "had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,\n",
      "more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\n",
      "and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when\n",
      "her husband united them together in one noisy purpose,\n",
      "immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her\n",
      "mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,\n",
      "though always unwilling to join any of their parties,\n",
      "was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\n",
      "seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily\n",
      "preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.\n",
      "The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor\n",
      "had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought\n",
      "or expression, and nothing could be less interesting\n",
      "than the whole of their discourse both in the dining\n",
      "parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children\n",
      "accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was\n",
      "too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's\n",
      "attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the\n",
      "removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed,\n",
      "and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\n",
      "entertained a hope of finding time for conversation\n",
      "at the park.  They all rose up in preparation for a round game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy,\n",
      "\"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria's\n",

      "to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly\n",
      "and replied, \"Indeed you are very much mistaken,\n",
      "Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can\n",
      "make your party without me, or I should have been at my\n",
      "filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel\n",
      "for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now,\n",
      "I am resolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--\n",
      "will you ring the bell for some working candles?\n",
      "My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know,\n",
      "if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I\n",
      "told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends\n",
      "upon having it done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy directly drew her work table near her\n",
      "and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness\n",
      "which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater\n",
      "delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.\n",
      "No one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual\n",
      "inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed,\n",
      "\"Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you\n",
      "know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;\n",
      "I have not touched it since it was tuned.\"  And without\n",
      "farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\n",
      "\n",

      "that SHE had never made so rude a speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument\n",
      "you know, ma'am,\" said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth\n",
      "away the offence; \"and I do not much wonder at it; for it\n",
      "is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining five were now to draw their cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen\n",
      "to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,\n",
      "in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still\n",
      "to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible\n",
      "I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.\n",
      "I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow\n",
      "me a share in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you\n",
      "for your help,\" cried Lucy, \"for I find there is more\n",
      "to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would\n",
      "be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele--\n",
      "\"Dear little soul, how I do love her!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor;\n",
      "\"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be\n",
      "as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,\n",
      "or will you take your chance now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals,\n",
      "and thus by a little of that address which Marianne\n",
      "could never condescend to practise, gained her own end,\n",
      "and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.  Lucy made room\n",
      "for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were\n",
      "thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\n",
      "utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.\n",
      "The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own\n",
      "music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten\n",
      "that any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily\n",
      "so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely,\n",
      "under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\n",
      "subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\n",

      "\n",
      "In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have\n",
      "honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance,\n",
      "or no farther curiosity on its subject.  I will\n",
      "not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking\n",
      "the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was\n",
      "somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I\n",
      "told you that Monday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\"\n",
      "and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,\n",
      "\"nothing could be farther from my intention than to give\n",
      "you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for the trust,\n",
      "that was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet I do assure you,\" replied Lucy, her little\n",
      "sharp eyes full of meaning, \"there seemed to me to be\n",
      "a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me\n",
      "quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was angry with me;\n",
      "and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having\n",
      "took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.\n",
      "But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy,\n",
      "and that you really do not blame me.  If you knew what a\n",
      "consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you\n",
      "of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life,\n",
      "your compassion would make you overlook every thing else\n",
      "I am sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great\n",
      "relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be\n",
      "assured that you shall never have reason to repent it.\n",
      "Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to\n",
      "be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need\n",
      "of all your mutual affection to support you under them.\n",
      "Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would\n",
      "be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,\n",
      "I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.\n",
      "I have been always used to a very small income, and could\n",
      "struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well\n",
      "to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that\n",
      "his mother might give him if he married to please her.\n",
      "We must wait, it may be for many years.  With almost every\n",
      "other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;\n",
      "but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of\n",
      "I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That conviction must be every thing to you;\n",
      "and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your's.\n",
      "If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed,\n",
      "as between many people, and under many circumstances\n",
      "it naturally would during a four years' engagement,\n",
      "your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "that could give her words a suspicious tendency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Edward's love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty\n",
      "well put to the test, by our long, very long absence\n",
      "since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial\n",
      "so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.\n",
      "I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's\n",
      "alarm on that account from the first.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "by nature, and from our different situations in life,\n",
      "from his being so much more in the world than me, and our\n",
      "continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion,\n",
      "to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been\n",
      "the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,\n",
      "or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for,\n",
      "or if he had talked more of one lady than another,\n",
      "or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he\n",
      "used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am particularly\n",
      "observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\n",
      "I am sure I could not be deceived.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"But what,\" said she after a short silence,\n",
      "\"are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy and shocking\n",
      "extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this,\n",
      "and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense\n",
      "in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk\n",
      "of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we could be certain that it would be only\n",
      "for a while!  But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong\n",
      "proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing\n",
      "it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,\n",
      "and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away\n",
      "all my inclination for hasty measures.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying\n",
      "your disinterestedness beyond reason.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A great coxcomb!\" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had\n",
      "caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.--\n",
      "\"Oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No sister,\" cried Lucy, \"you are mistaken there, our\n",
      "favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; \"for he is one\n",
      "of the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw;\n",
      "but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature,\n",
      "there is no finding out who SHE likes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip,\n",
      "and looked angrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took\n",
      "place for some time.  Lucy first put an end to it by saying\n",
      "in a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them\n",
      "the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has\n",
      "lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;\n",
      "indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you\n",
      "are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen enough\n",
      "of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\n",
      "other profession; now my plan is that he should take\n",
      "orders as soon as he can, and then through your interest,\n",
      "which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of\n",
      "friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me,\n",
      "your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;\n",
      "which I understand is a very good one, and the present\n",
      "incumbent not likely to live a great while.  That would\n",
      "be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time\n",
      "and chance for the rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should always be happy,\" replied Elinor, \"to show\n",
      "any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars;\n",
      "but do you not perceive that my interest on such an\n",
      "occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is brother\n",
      "to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough\n",
      "to her husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve\n",
      "of Edward's going into orders.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I rather suspect that my interest would\n",
      "do very little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were again silent for many minutes.  At length\n",
      "Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end\n",
      "to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.\n",
      "We seem so beset with difficulties on every side,\n",
      "that though it would make us miserable for a time,\n",
      "we should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will\n",
      "not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed\n",
      "very agitated feelings, \"on such a subject I certainly\n",
      "will not.  You know very well that my opinion would have\n",
      "no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you wrong me,\" replied Lucy, with great\n",
      "solemnity; \"I know nobody of whose judgment I think\n",
      "so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe,\n",
      "that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all means\n",
      "to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars,\n",
      "it will be more for the happiness of both of you,'\n",
      "I should resolve upon doing it immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's\n",
      "future wife, and replied, \"This compliment would effectually\n",
      "frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject\n",
      "had I formed one.  It raises my influence much too high;\n",
      "the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\n",
      "is too much for an indifferent person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said Lucy,\n",
      "with some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words,\n",
      "\"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me.\n",
      "If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect\n",
      "by your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this,\n",
      "lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase\n",
      "of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined\n",
      "never to mention the subject again.  Another pause\n",
      "therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech,\n",
      "and Lucy was still the first to end it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\"\n",

      "of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwise\n",
      "London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\"\n",

      "for nothing had been said on either side to make them\n",
      "dislike each other less than they had done before;\n",
      "and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy\n",

      "for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had\n",
      "not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage,\n",
      "which sincere affection on HER side would have given,\n",
      "for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man\n",

      "her confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter\n",
      "from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness\n",
      "and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;\n",

      "Since the death of her husband, who had traded with success\n",

      "happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.\n",

      "almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness\n",
      "to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\n",
      "opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her\n",
      "mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected\n",
      "to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,\n",
      "which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which\n",
      "on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.\n",

      "of that kind with very little effort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not help smiling at this display of\n",
      "indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she\n",
      "had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave\n",
      "with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,\n",
      "that if her sister persisted in going, she would\n",
      "go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne\n",
      "should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,\n",
      "or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy\n",
      "of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.\n",
      "To this determination she was the more easily reconciled,\n",

      "was not to be in town before February; and that\n",
      "their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,\n",
      "might be previously finished.\n",

      "\"these objections are nonsensical.  You will have much\n",
      "pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together;\n",
      "and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,\n",
      "she would foresee it there from a variety of sources;\n",
      "she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\n",
      "acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of\n",
      "attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the\n",
      "attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might\n",
      "be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now\n",
      "on this attack, though almost hopeless of success,\n",
      "she forced herself to begin her design by saying,\n",
      "as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward Ferrars very much,\n",
      "and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest\n",
      "of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference\n",
      "to me, whether I am ever known to them or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.\n",
      "Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor\n",

      "deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;\n",
      "nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John\n",
      "was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety\n",
      "was the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two,\n",
      "to the number of inhabitants in London, was something.\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted\n",
      "her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected\n",
      "to feel.  With regard to herself, it was now a matter\n",
      "of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when\n",
      "she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,\n",
      "and her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,\n",
      "restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more\n",
      "than her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied\n",
      "with the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust\n",
      "the consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness,\n",
      "so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her\n",

      "mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the\n",
      "moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.\n",
      "Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor\n",
      "was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider\n",
      "the separation as any thing short of eternal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their departure took place in the first week in January.\n",
      "The Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "and beginning a journey to London under her protection,\n",
      "and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation,\n",
      "so short had their acquaintance with that lady been,\n",
      "so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition,\n",
      "and so many had been her objections against such a measure\n",
      "only a few days before! But these objections had all,\n",
      "with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother\n",
      "equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor,\n",
      "in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy,\n",
      "could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation\n",
      "which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes\n",
      "of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect,\n",
      "how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison,\n",
      "and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of\n",
      "Marianne's situation to have the same animating object\n",
      "in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a very\n",
      "short time however must now decide what Willoughby's\n",
      "intentions were; in all probability he was already in town.\n",
      "Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\n",
      "on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon\n",
      "gaining every new light as to his character which her\n",
      "own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\n",
      "but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister\n",
      "with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was\n",
      "and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\n",
      "Should the result of her observations be unfavourable,\n",
      "she was determined at all events to open the eyes\n",
      "of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions\n",
      "would be of a different nature--she must then learn\n",
      "to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret\n",
      "which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's\n",
      "behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what\n",
      "future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "might be expected to be.  She sat in silence almost all\n",
      "the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever\n",
      "voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\n",
      "beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation\n",
      "of delight exclusively addressed to her sister.  To atone\n",
      "for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession\n",
      "of the post of civility which she had assigned herself,\n",
      "behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\n",
      "whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side\n",
      "treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous\n",
      "on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only\n",
      "disturbed that she could not make them choose their own\n",
      "dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\n",
      "preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.\n",
      "They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to\n",
      "be released, after such a journey, from the confinement\n",
      "of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up,\n",
      "and the young ladies were immediately put in possession\n",
      "of a very comfortable apartment.  It had formerly\n",
      "been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung\n",
      "a landscape in coloured silks of her performance,\n",
      "in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school\n",
      "in town to some effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "As dinner was not to be ready in less than two\n",
      "hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ\n",
      "the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for\n",
      "that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did the same.\n",
      "\"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\n",
      "better defer your letter for a day or two?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am NOT going to write to my mother,\"\n",
      "replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid\n",
      "any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it immediately\n",
      "struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;\n",
      "and the conclusion which as instantly followed was,\n",
      "that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct\n",
      "the affair, they must be engaged.  This conviction,\n",
      "though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,\n",
      "and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\n",
      "Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes;\n",
      "in length it could be no more than a note; it was then\n",
      "folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.\n",
      "Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in\n",
      "the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,\n",
      "ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it\n",
      "to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.\n",
      "This decided the matter at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her spirits still continued very high; but there\n",
      "was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much\n",
      "pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as\n",
      "the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any dinner,\n",
      "and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,\n",
      "seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "by being much engaged in her own room, could see little\n",
      "of what was passing.  The tea things were brought in,\n",
      "and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once\n",
      "by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\n",
      "heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,\n",
      "Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,\n",
      "and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.\n",
      "Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;\n",
      "she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,\n",
      "and after listening half a minute, returned into the room\n",
      "in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\n",
      "him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her\n",
      "feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,\n",
      "\"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed\n",
      "almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel\n",
      "Brandon appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,\n",
      "and she immediately left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too;\n",
      "but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured\n",
      "his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that\n",
      "a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she\n",
      "experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.\n",
      "She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,\n",
      "that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,\n",
      "with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him\n",
      "the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor answered in some distress that she was,\n",
      "and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;\n",
      "and of every thing to which she could decently attribute\n",
      "her sister's behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her with the most earnest attention,\n",
      "but seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,\n",
      "and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them\n",
      "in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey,\n",
      "and the friends they had left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this calm kind of way, with very little interest\n",
      "on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out\n",
      "of spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.\n",
      "Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were\n",
      "then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain\n",
      "by any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way\n",
      "of saying something, she asked if he had been in London\n",
      "ever since she had seen him last.  \"Yes,\" he replied,\n",
      "with some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; I have been\n",
      "once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never\n",
      "been in my power to return to Barton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This, and the manner in which it was said,\n",
      "immediately brought back to her remembrance all the\n",
      "circumstances of his quitting that place, with the\n",
      "uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "and she was fearful that her question had implied\n",
      "much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she,\n",
      "with her usual noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad\n",
      "to see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your\n",
      "pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little,\n",
      "and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I\n",
      "have been at home, and you know one has always a world\n",
      "of little odd things to do after one has been away for\n",
      "any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with--\n",
      "Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!\n",
      "But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should\n",
      "be in town today?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's,\n",
      "where I have been dining.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their\n",
      "house?  How does Charlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine\n",
      "size by this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned\n",
      "to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel,\n",
      "I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is,\n",
      "you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.\n",
      "Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be\n",
      "sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing\n",
      "to be young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I\n",
      "never was very handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got\n",
      "a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest\n",
      "beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has been dead\n",
      "these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have\n",
      "you been to since we parted?  And how does your business\n",
      "go on?  Come, come, let's have no secrets among friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied with his accustomary mildness to all\n",
      "her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.\n",
      "Elinor now began to make the tea, and Marianne was\n",
      "obliged to appear again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became\n",
      "more thoughtful and silent than he had been before,\n",
      "and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long.\n",
      "No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies\n",
      "were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits\n",
      "and happy looks.  The disappointment of the evening before\n",
      "seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen\n",
      "that day.  They had not long finished their breakfast before\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few\n",
      "minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted\n",
      "to see them all, that it was hard to say whether she\n",
      "received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods again.  So surprised at their coming to town,\n",
      "though it was what she had rather expected all along;\n",
      "so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation\n",
      "after having declined her own, though at the same time\n",

      "\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\"\n",
      "said she; \"What do you think he said when he heard\n",
      "of your coming with Mamma?  I forget what it was now,\n",
      "but it was something so droll!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour or two spent in what her mother called\n",
      "comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry\n",
      "concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side,\n",
      "and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's, it was\n",
      "proposed by the latter that they should all accompany\n",
      "her to some shops where she had business that morning,\n",
      "to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented,\n",
      "as having likewise some purchases to make themselves;\n",
      "and Marianne, though declining it at first was induced\n",
      "to go likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wherever they went, she was evidently always on\n",
      "the watch.  In Bond Street especially, where much of\n",
      "their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;\n",
      "and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was\n",
      "equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\n",
      "from all that interested and occupied the others.\n",
      "Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could\n",
      "never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,\n",
      "however it might equally concern them both: she received\n",
      "no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\n",
      "home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation\n",
      "at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught\n",
      "by every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild\n",
      "to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\n",
      "time in rapture and indecision.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was late in the morning before they returned home;\n",
      "and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew\n",
      "eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found\n",
      "her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance,\n",
      "which declared that no Willoughby had been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\"\n",
      "said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels.\n",
      "She was answered in the negative.  \"Are you quite sure\n",

      "voice, as she turned away to the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself,\n",
      "regarding her sister with uneasiness.  \"If she had not\n",
      "known him to be in town she would not have written to him,\n",
      "as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;\n",
      "and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither\n",
      "come nor write!  Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong\n",
      "in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,\n",
      "a man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful,\n",
      "so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will MY\n",
      "interference be borne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She determined, after some consideration, that if\n",
      "appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they\n",
      "now were, she would represent in the strongest manner\n",
      "to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the\n",
      "affair.\n",

      "Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited\n",
      "in the morning, dined with them.  The former left them\n",
      "soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;\n",
      "and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\n",
      "for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions,\n",
      "as she would never learn the game; but though her time\n",
      "was therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no\n",
      "means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor,\n",
      "for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the\n",
      "pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured for a\n",
      "few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,\n",
      "and she returned to the more interesting employment\n",
      "of walking backwards and forwards across the room,\n",
      "pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,\n",
      "in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "when they met at breakfast the following morning,\n",
      "\"Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week;\n",
      "'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure.\n",
      "Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem\n",
      "to take it so much to heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice,\n",
      "and walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.\n",
      "\"I had not thought of that.  This weather will keep many\n",
      "sportsmen in the country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were\n",
      "restored by it.  \"It is charming weather for THEM indeed,\"\n",
      "she continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table\n",
      "with a happy countenance.  \"How much they must enjoy\n",
      "it! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot\n",
      "be expected to last long.  At this time of the year,\n",
      "and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly\n",
      "have very little more of it.  Frosts will soon set in,\n",
      "and in all probability with severity.  In another day\n",
      "or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last\n",
      "longer--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly\n",
      "as she did, \"I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady\n",
      "Middleton in town by the end of next week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do.  Mary always\n",
      "has her own way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will\n",
      "write to Combe by this day's post.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away\n",
      "with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain\n",
      "the fact.  Whatever the truth of it might be, and far\n",
      "as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,\n",
      "yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be\n",
      "very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits;\n",
      "happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier\n",
      "in her expectation of a frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at\n",
      "the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform\n",
      "them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time\n",
      "busy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the\n",
      "variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning,\n",
      "Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference.\n",
      "I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.  It was\n",
      "not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem parting too,\n",
      "the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\n",
      "clear afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was alternately diverted and pained;\n",
      "but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the\n",
      "brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance\n",
      "of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be\n",
      "dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set\n",
      "of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,\n",
      "which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her household\n",
      "arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,\n",
      "and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady\n",
      "Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited\n",
      "no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose\n",
      "the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find\n",
      "herself more comfortably situated in that particular than\n",
      "she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound\n",
      "for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their\n",
      "evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,\n",
      "formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation\n",
      "to the house, was with them almost every day; he came\n",
      "to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived\n",
      "more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any\n",
      "other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time\n",
      "with much concern his continued regard for her sister.\n",
      "She feared it was a strengthening regard.  It grieved her\n",
      "to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,\n",
      "and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a week after their arrival, it became\n",
      "certain that Willoughby was also arrived.  His card\n",
      "was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while\n",
      "we were out.\"  Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his\n",
      "being in London, now ventured to say, \"Depend upon it,\n",
      "he will call again tomorrow.\"  But Marianne seemed\n",
      "hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's entrance,\n",
      "escaped with the precious card.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor,\n",
      "restored to those of her sister all, and more than all,\n",
      "their former agitation.  From this moment her mind was\n",
      "never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour\n",
      "of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted\n",
      "on being left behind, the next morning, when the others\n",
      "went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing\n",
      "in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's\n",
      "glance at her sister when they returned was enough to\n",
      "inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.\n",
      "A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, ma'am, for my mistress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor,\n",
      "unable to be longer silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, a little--not much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short pause.  \"You have no confidence\n",
      "in me, Marianne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have\n",
      "confidence in no one!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed,\n",
      "Marianne, I have nothing to tell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations\n",
      "then are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;\n",
      "you, because you do not communicate, and I, because\n",
      "I conceal nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself,\n",
      "which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,\n",
      "under such circumstances, to press for greater openness\n",
      "in Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being\n",
      "given her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,\n",
      "announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,\n",
      "and requesting the company of her mother and cousins\n",
      "the following evening.  Business on Sir John's part,\n",
      "and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling\n",
      "in Berkeley Street.  The invitation was accepted;\n",
      "but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as\n",
      "it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they\n",
      "should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\n",
      "difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still\n",
      "she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was\n",
      "not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling\n",
      "to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor found, when the evening was over,\n",
      "that disposition is not materially altered by a change\n",
      "of abode, for although scarcely settled in town,\n",
      "Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\n",
      "young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was\n",
      "an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.\n",
      "In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;\n",
      "but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more\n",
      "important and less easily attained, it was risking too much\n",
      "for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that\n",
      "Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,\n",
      "with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former,\n",
      "whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,\n",
      "as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention\n",
      "to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,\n",
      "they received no mark of recognition on their entrance.\n",
      "He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\n",
      "who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from\n",
      "the other side of the room.  Marianne gave one glance\n",
      "round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE\n",
      "was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed\n",
      "to receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been\n",
      "assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards\n",
      "the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them\n",
      "in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed\n",
      "of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\n",
      "something very droll on hearing that they were to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When do you go back again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance\n",
      "in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much\n",
      "fatigued by the exercise.  She complained of it\n",
      "as they returned to Berkeley Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason\n",
      "of all that very well; if a certain person who shall\n",
      "be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a\n",
      "bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty\n",
      "of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir\n",
      "John met him somewhere in the street this morning.\"\n",
      "Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.\n",
      "Impatient in this situation to be doing something\n",
      "that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved\n",
      "to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped\n",
      "by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,\n",
      "to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;\n",
      "and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\n",
      "by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne\n",
      "was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose\n",
      "it to be to any other person.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by\n",
      "herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,\n",
      "while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious\n",
      "for conversation, walked from one window to the other,\n",
      "or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\n",
      "Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,\n",
      "relating all that had passed, her suspicions of\n",
      "Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea\n",
      "of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account\n",
      "of her real situation with respect to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap\n",
      "foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.\n",
      "Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated\n",
      "company of any kind, left the room before he entered it.\n",
      "He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\n",
      "satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he\n",
      "had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some\n",
      "time without saying a word.  Elinor, persuaded that he\n",
      "had some communication to make in which her sister\n",
      "was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.\n",
      "It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind\n",
      "of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with\n",
      "the observation of \"your sister looks unwell to-day,\"\n",
      "or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared\n",
      "on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\n",
      "something particular about her.  After a pause of several\n",
      "minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her\n",
      "in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate\n",
      "her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not\n",
      "prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,\n",
      "was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,\n",
      "of asking what he meant?  He tried to smile as he replied,\n",
      "\"your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally\n",
      "known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor,\n",
      "\"for her own family do not know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon,\n",
      "I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not\n",
      "supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,\n",
      "and their marriage is universally talked of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard\n",
      "it mentioned?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others\n",
      "with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,\n",
      "and the Middletons.  But still I might not have believed it,\n",
      "for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to\n",
      "be convinced, it will always find something to support\n",
      "its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\n",
      "accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to\n",
      "Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing.  I came to inquire,\n",
      "but I was convinced before I could ask the question.\n",
      "Is every thing finally settled?  Is it impossible to-?\n",
      "But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.\n",
      "Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong\n",
      "in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on\n",
      "your prudence I have the strongest dependence.  Tell me\n",
      "that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,\n",
      "that in short concealment, if concealment be possible,\n",
      "is all that remains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal\n",
      "of his love for her sister, affected her very much.\n",
      "She was not immediately able to say anything, and even\n",
      "when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short\n",
      "time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.\n",
      "The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister\n",
      "was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring\n",
      "to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much\n",
      "as too little.  Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's\n",
      "affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection\n",
      "might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct\n",
      "from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,\n",
      "after some consideration, to say more than she really knew\n",
      "or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though\n",
      "she had never been informed by themselves of the terms\n",
      "on which they stood with each other, of their mutual\n",
      "affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence\n",
      "she was not astonished to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened to her with silent attention, and on\n",
      "her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,\n",
      "and after saying in a voice of emotion, \"to your sister\n",
      "I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\n",
      "may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this\n",
      "conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on\n",

      "she could not reflect without the deepest concern.\n",

      "Marianne, to the surprise of her sister,\n",

      "and returned her those civilities, which her sister could\n",
      "not make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw\n",
      "that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing\n",

      "She treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness\n",
      "of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of\n",

      "a very wealthy man.  But the family are all rich together.\n",

      "in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!\n",
      "Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we\n",
      "were there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful\n",
      "stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,\n",
      "in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is\n",
      "close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from\n",
      "the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only\n",
      "go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house,\n",
      "you may see all the carriages that pass along.\n",
      "Oh! 'tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the village,\n",

      "that her sister received from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go\n",
      "to bed.\" But this, from the momentary perverseness\n",
      "of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.\n",
      "Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,\n",
      "soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her\n",
      "lay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,\n",
      "in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,\n",
      "she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass,\n",
      "full of something, in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected\n",
      "that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the\n",
      "house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it\n",
      "for your sister.  My poor husband! how fond he was of it!\n",
      "Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said\n",
      "it did him more good than any thing else in the world.\n",
      "Do take it to your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Ma'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference\n",
      "of the complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good\n",
      "you are!  But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope,\n",
      "almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much\n",
      "service to her as rest, if you will give me leave,\n",
      "I will drink the wine myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been\n",
      "five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;\n",
      "and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,\n",
      "that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,\n",
      "of little importance to her, its healing powers,\n",
      "on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\n",
      "on herself as on her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea,\n",
      "and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne,\n",
      "Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected\n",
      "nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\n",
      "was already aware of what occasioned her absence.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought;\n",
      "for soon after his entrance, she walked across the room\n",
      "to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--\n",
      "\"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows\n",
      "nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's,\n",
      "and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his\n",
      "good information, inquired after her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne is not well,\" said she.  \"She has been\n",
      "indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I\n",
      "heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it\n",
      "than I could believe possible at first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short,\n",
      "that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I\n",
      "tell you?  If you know it already, as surely you must,\n",
      "I may be spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness,\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO\n",
      "know it all.  This seems to have been a day of general\n",
      "elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.\n",
      "Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I\n",
      "had business.  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,\n",
      "and one of them was giving the other an account of the\n",
      "intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,\n",
      "that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name\n",
      "of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,\n",
      "first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive\n",
      "assertion that every thing was now finally settled\n",
      "respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer\n",
      "to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\n",
      "with many particulars of preparations and other matters.\n",
      "One thing, especially, I remember, because it served\n",
      "to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony\n",
      "was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat\n",
      "in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be\n",
      "impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative\n",
      "lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop\n",
      "till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I\n",
      "have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey\n",
      "has fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,\n",
      "we may find an explanation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least\n",
      "I think\"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice\n",
      "which seemed to distrust itself, \"And your sister--\n",
      "how did she--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have\n",
      "only to hope that they may be proportionately short.\n",
      "It has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  Till yesterday,\n",
      "I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,\n",
      "perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was\n",
      "really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and,\n",
      "in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed!  But\n",
      "your sister does not--I think you said so--she does\n",
      "not consider quite as you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly\n",
      "she would still justify him if she could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal\n",
      "of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,\n",
      "the subject was necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had\n",
      "watched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who\n",
      "expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication,\n",
      "in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side,\n",
      "as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope\n",
      "and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From a night of more sleep than she had expected,\n",
      "Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness\n",
      "of misery in which she had closed her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk\n",
      "of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had\n",
      "gone through the subject again and again; and with the same\n",
      "steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side,\n",
      "the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\n",
      "Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could believe\n",
      "Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,\n",
      "and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility\n",
      "of acquitting him.  At one moment she was absolutely\n",
      "indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another\n",
      "she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\n",
      "could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however,\n",
      "she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,\n",
      "where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.\n",
      "Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "entering into her sorrows with any compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried;\n",
      "\"she cannot feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy;\n",
      "her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants\n",
      "is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice\n",
      "to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,\n",
      "by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too\n",
      "great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a\n",
      "strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.\n",
      "Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there\n",
      "be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent\n",
      "abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither\n",
      "reasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people\n",
      "the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged\n",
      "of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions\n",
      "on herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the\n",
      "sisters were together in their own room after breakfast,\n",
      "which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower\n",
      "in her estimation; because, through her own weakness,\n",
      "it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\n",
      "though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse\n",
      "of the utmost goodwill.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance\n",
      "gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,\n",
      "she entered their room, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure\n",
      "will do you good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination\n",
      "placed before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness\n",
      "and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,\n",
      "convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,\n",
      "rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,\n",
      "by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.\n",
      "The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.\n",
      "The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,\n",
      "was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment\n",
      "which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,\n",
      "she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within\n",
      "her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,\n",
      "could have expressed; and now she could reproach her\n",
      "only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\n",
      "passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely\n",
      "lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,\n",
      "she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.\n",
      "But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,\n",
      "brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled every page.\n",
      "Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying\n",
      "as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused\n",
      "by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater\n",
      "openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness\n",
      "towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such\n",
      "a conviction of their future happiness in each other,\n",
      "that she wept with agony through the whole of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "All her impatience to be at home again now returned;\n",
      "her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through\n",
      "the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,\n",
      "and she was wildly urgent to be gone.  Elinor, unable herself\n",
      "to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be\n",
      "in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own\n",
      "except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;\n",
      "and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait\n",
      "for that knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she\n",
      "could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able\n",
      "to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing\n",
      "Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest\n",
      "of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of\n",
      "the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,\n",
      "by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying\n",
      "any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother\n",
      "an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions\n",
      "for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room\n",
      "on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table\n",
      "where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,\n",
      "grieving over her for the hardship of such a task,\n",
      "and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner they had continued about a quarter\n",
      "of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then\n",
      "bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor.  \"So early too! I\n",
      "thought we HAD been safe.\"\n",

      "your sister Marianne.\"\n",

      "\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality\n",
      "of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance\n",
      "between them, as well in mind as person.  The same warmth\n",
      "of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.\n",
      "This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from\n",
      "her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.\n",
      "Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years\n",
      "we were playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the\n",

      "as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my\n",

      "incapable of having ever felt.  Her's, for me, was, I believe,\n",
      "fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\n",

      "married--married against her inclination to my brother.\n",
      "Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\n",

      "My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.\n",
      "I had hoped that her regard for me would support her\n",
      "under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at\n",
      "last the misery of her situation, for she experienced\n",
      "great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\n",
      "she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I\n",

      "We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.\n",
      "The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us.\n",
      "I was banished to the house of a relation far distant,\n",
      "and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\n",
      "till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her\n",
      "fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--\n",
      "but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,\n",
      "a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least\n",
      "I should not have now to lament it.  This however\n",
      "was not the case.  My brother had no regard for her;\n",
      "his pleasures were not what they ought to have been,\n",
      "and from the first he treated her unkindly.  The consequence\n",
      "of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced\n",
      "as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She resigned\n",
      "herself at first to all the misery of her situation;\n",
      "and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\n",
      "regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we\n",

      "my father lived only a few months after their marriage,\n",
      "and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she\n",
      "should fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I\n",
      "meant to promote the happiness of both by removing\n",
      "from her for years, and for that purpose had procured\n",
      "my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\n",
      "he continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of\n",
      "trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,\n",

      "minutes about the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation,\n",
      "and still more by his distress, could not speak.  He saw\n",
      "her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,\n",
      "and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few minutes more\n",
      "of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy\n",
      "period before I returned to England.  My first care,\n",
      "when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;\n",
      "but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.\n",
      "I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there\n",
      "was every reason to fear that she had removed from him\n",
      "only to sink deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance\n",
      "was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her\n",
      "comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that\n",
      "the power of receiving it had been made over some months\n",
      "before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he\n",
      "imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,\n",
      "had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.\n",
      "At last, however, and after I had been six months in England,\n",
      "I DID find her.  Regard for a former servant of my own,\n",
      "who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit\n",
      "him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;\n",
      "and there, the same house, under a similar confinement,\n",
      "was my unfortunate sister.  So altered--so faded--worn\n",
      "down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I\n",
      "believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me,\n",
      "to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\n",
      "on whom I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding\n",
      "her--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting\n",
      "to describe it--I have pained you too much already.\n",
      "That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage\n",
      "of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was\n",
      "my greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her,\n",
      "beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;\n",
      "and that was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,\n",
      "and under proper attendants; I visited her every day\n",
      "during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her\n",
      "last moments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor\n",
      "spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,\n",
      "at the fate of his unfortunate friend.\n",

      "\"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my\n",

      "disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,\n",
      "or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you\n",
      "will live to see the other be.  But to what does all this\n",
      "lead?  I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.\n",
      "Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched\n",
      "for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!\n",
      "I WILL be more collected--more concise.  She left to my care\n",
      "her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first\n",
      "guilty connection, who was then about three years old.\n",
      "She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.\n",
      "It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly\n",
      "would I have discharged it in the strictest sense,\n",
      "by watching over her education myself, had the nature\n",
      "of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home;\n",
      "and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school.\n",
      "I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my\n",
      "brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which\n",
      "left to me the possession of the family property,) she\n",
      "visited me at Delaford.  I called her a distant relation;\n",
      "but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected\n",
      "of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now three\n",
      "years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)\n",
      "that I removed her from school, to place her under the care\n",
      "of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,\n",
      "who had the charge of four or five other girls of about\n",
      "the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason\n",
      "to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,\n",
      "almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.\n",
      "I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\n",
      "out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of\n",
      "her young friends, who was attending her father there\n",
      "for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,\n",
      "and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,\n",
      "for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,\n",
      "she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she\n",
      "certainly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,\n",
      "but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,\n",
      "give no information; for he had been generally confined\n",
      "to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town\n",
      "and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried\n",
      "to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,\n",
      "of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business.\n",
      "In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;\n",
      "all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.\n",

      "suffered too.\"\n",

      "Willoughby!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued,\n",
      "\"came in a letter from herself, last October.\n",
      "It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it\n",
      "on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;\n",
      "and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\n",
      "which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange\n",
      "to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.\n",
      "Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his\n",
      "looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,\n",
      "that I was called away to the relief of one whom he\n",
      "had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,\n",
      "what would it have availed?  Would he have been less\n",
      "gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?  No,\n",
      "he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel\n",
      "for another would do.  He had left the girl whose\n",
      "youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of\n",
      "the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,\n",
      "no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had left her,\n",

      "\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.\n",

      "known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing\n",
      "your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured\n",
      "that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt\n",
      "for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and\n",
      "found you alone, I came determined to know the truth;\n",
      "though irresolute what to do when it WAS known.\n",
      "My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;\n",
      "but now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be\n",
      "so deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?\n",
      "I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes\n",
      "I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him.\n",
      "But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\n",
      "were his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been,\n",
      "however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL\n",
      "turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she\n",
      "compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers\n",
      "the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,\n",
      "and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,\n",
      "still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented\n",
      "by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\n",
      "Surely this comparison must have its use with her.\n",
      "She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They\n",
      "proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.\n",
      "On the contrary, every friend must be made still more\n",
      "her friend by them.  Concern for her unhappiness,\n",
      "and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\n",
      "every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,\n",
      "in communicating to her what I have told you.  You must\n",
      "know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,\n",
      "and from my heart believed it might be of service,\n",
      "might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered\n",
      "myself to trouble you with this account of my family\n",

      "by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,\n",
      "the effect on her was not entirely such as the former\n",
      "had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne appeared to distrust\n",
      "the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all\n",
      "with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\n",
      "objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,\n",

      "with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she\n",

      "she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did become\n",
      "settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\n",
      "She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily\n",
      "than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and\n",
      "desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl,\n",
      "and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been\n",
      "on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\n",
      "that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt\n",
      "even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,\n",
      "gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated\n",

      "\n",
      "To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood\n",

      "Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.\n",
      "Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\n",
      "arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;\n",

      "she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.\n",
      "Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be,\n",

      "it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely,\n",
      "comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man;\n",
      "and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect\n",
      "of a very respectable establishment in life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am\n",
      "convinced of it.  What is the amount of his fortune?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself\n",
      "up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added,\n",
      "\"Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much,\n",
      "for your sake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am\n",
      "very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish\n",
      "of marrying ME.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.\n",
      "A very little trouble on your side secures him.\n",
      "Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness\n",
      "of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends\n",
      "may all advise him against it.  But some of those little\n",
      "attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily\n",
      "give will fix him, in spite of himself.  And there can be\n",
      "no reason why you should not try for him.  It is not to be\n",
      "supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,\n",
      "you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\n",
      "out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--\n",
      "you have too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon\n",
      "must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on\n",
      "my part to make him pleased with you and your family.\n",
      "It is a match that must give universal satisfaction.\n",
      "In short, it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his voice\n",
      "to an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome\n",
      "to ALL PARTIES.\" Recollecting himself, however, he added,\n",
      "\"That is, I mean to say--your friends are all truly\n",
      "anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly,\n",
      "for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.\n",
      "And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman,\n",
      "I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\n",
      "the other day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued,\n",
      "\"something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I\n",
      "a sister settling at the same time.  And yet it is not\n",
      "very unlikely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution,\n",
      "\"going to be married?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not actually settled, but there is such\n",
      "a thing in agitation.  He has a most excellent mother.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,\n",
      "and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match\n",
      "takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\n",
      "of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.\n",
      "A very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not\n",
      "a doubt of its taking place in time.  A thousand a-year\n",
      "is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over\n",
      "for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give\n",
      "you another instance of her liberality:--The other day,\n",
      "as soon as we came to town, aware that money could\n",
      "not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes\n",
      "into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.\n",
      "And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\n",
      "expense while we are here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused for her assent and compassion; and she\n",
      "forced herself to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly\n",
      "be considerable; but your income is a large one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.\n",
      "I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly\n",
      "a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.\n",
      "The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,\n",
      "is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little\n",
      "purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,\n",
      "you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.\n",
      "The land was so very desirable for me in every respect,\n",
      "so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it\n",
      "my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my\n",
      "conscience to let it fall into any other hands.  A man must\n",
      "pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal\n",
      "of money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again,\n",
      "the next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the\n",
      "purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed;\n",
      "for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not\n",
      "happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands,\n",
      "I must have sold out to very great loss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could only smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have\n",
      "had on first coming to Norland.  Our respected father,\n",
      "as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects\n",
      "that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)\n",
      "to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his\n",
      "doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his\n",
      "own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,\n",
      "we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,\n",
      "china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.\n",
      "You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we\n",
      "must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's\n",
      "kindness is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality,\n",
      "I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\"\n",
      "he gravely replied; \"but however there is still a great\n",
      "deal to be done.  There is not a stone laid of Fanny's\n",
      "green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden\n",
      "marked out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old\n",
      "walnut trees are all come down to make room for it.\n",
      "It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,\n",
      "and the flower-garden will slope down just before it,\n",
      "and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old\n",
      "thorns that grew in patches over the brow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself;\n",
      "and was very thankful that Marianne was not present,\n",
      "to share the provocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now said enough to make his poverty clear,\n",
      "and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings\n",
      "for each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray's\n",
      "his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to\n",
      "congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house,\n",
      "her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;\n",
      "and it is an acquaintance that has not only been\n",
      "of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove\n",
      "materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is\n",
      "certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it\n",
      "speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all\n",
      "probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--\n",
      "She must have a great deal to leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has\n",
      "only her jointure, which will descend to her children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to\n",
      "her income.  Few people of common prudence will do THAT;\n",
      "and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you not think it more likely that she\n",
      "should leave it to her daughters, than to us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married,\n",
      "and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her\n",
      "remembering them farther.  Whereas, in my opinion, by her\n",
      "taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this\n",
      "kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her\n",
      "future consideration, which a conscientious woman would\n",
      "not disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;\n",
      "and she can hardly do all this, without being aware\n",
      "of the expectation it raises.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she raises none in those most concerned.\n",
      "Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity\n",
      "carries you too far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself,\n",
      "\"people have little, have very little in their power.\n",
      "But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?--\n",
      "she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown\n",
      "quite thin.  Is she ill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint\n",
      "on her for several weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life,\n",
      "any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!\n",
      "Her's has been a very short one!  She was as handsome a girl\n",
      "last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract\n",
      "the man.  There was something in her style of beauty,\n",
      "to please them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say\n",
      "that she would marry sooner and better than you did;\n",
      "not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU, but so it\n",
      "happened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.\n",
      "I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth\n",
      "more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost,\n",
      "and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better.\n",
      "Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear\n",
      "Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;\n",

      "among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that\n",
      "there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon;\n",
      "but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself\n",
      "to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking\n",
      "an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage\n",
      "by every possible attention.  He had just compunction\n",
      "enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,\n",
      "to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should\n",
      "do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\n",
      "of atoning for his own neglect.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton\n",
      "at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.\n",
      "Abundance of civilities passed on all sides.  Sir John\n",
      "was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did\n",
      "not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him\n",
      "down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton\n",
      "saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his\n",
      "acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away\n",
      "delighted with both.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall have a charming account to carry\n",
      "to Fanny,\" said he, as he walked back with his sister.\n",
      "\"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman!  Such\n",
      "a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.\n",
      "And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman,\n",
      "though not so elegant as her daughter.  Your sister need\n",
      "not have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say\n",
      "the truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally;\n",
      "for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man\n",
      "who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither\n",
      "she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny\n",
      "would like to associate with.  But now I can carry her\n",
      "a most satisfactory account of both.\"\n",

      "Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her\n",
      "husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day\n",
      "both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her\n",
      "confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\n",
      "even the woman with whom her sisters were staying,\n",
      "by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton,\n",
      "she found her one of the most charming women in the world!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
      "There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides,\n",
      "which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised\n",
      "with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,\n",
      "and a general want of understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit\n",
      "the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing\n",
      "more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address,\n",
      "who met her husband's sisters without any affection,\n",
      "and almost without having anything to say to them;\n",
      "for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street,\n",
      "she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did\n",
      "not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town;\n",
      "but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily\n",
      "to mention his name before her, till able to tell her\n",
      "that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on,\n",
      "or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon\n",
      "were answered; because she believed them still so very\n",
      "much attached to each other, that they could not be too\n",
      "sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.\n",
      "The intelligence however, which SHE would not give,\n",
      "soon flowed from another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly\n",
      "to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward,\n",
      "though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
      "He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear\n",
      "of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet,\n",
      "was not to be told, they could do nothing at present\n",
      "but write.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward assured them himself of his being in town,\n",
      "within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.\n",
      "Twice was his card found on the table, when they returned\n",
      "from their morning's engagements.  Elinor was pleased\n",
      "that he had called; and still more pleased that she had\n",
      "missed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted\n",
      "with the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit\n",
      "of giving anything, they determined to give them--\n",
      "a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\n",
      "invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had\n",
      "taken a very good house for three months.  Their sisters\n",
      "and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood\n",
      "was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad\n",
      "to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager\n",
      "civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.\n",
      "They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\n",
      "whether her sons were to be of the party.  The expectation\n",
      "of seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested\n",
      "in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's\n",
      "mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised\n",
      "to attend such an introduction, though she could now see\n",
      "her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself,\n",
      "her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars,\n",
      "her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest with which she thus anticipated the\n",
      "party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully\n",
      "than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles\n",
      "were also to be at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton,\n",
      "so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,\n",
      "that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her\n",
      "sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John\n",
      "to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street;\n",
      "and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\n",
      "Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known,\n",
      "that their visit should begin a few days before the party\n",
      "took place.\n",

      "Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
      "as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had\n",
      "had the care of her brother, might not have done much,\n",
      "however, towards procuring them seats at her table;\n",
      "but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\n",
      "who had long wanted to be personally known to the family,\n",
      "to have a nearer view of their characters and her own\n",
      "difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring\n",
      "to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,\n",
      "than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began\n",
      "immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with\n",
      "his mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party\n",
      "given by his sister; and to see him for the first time,\n",
      "after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\n",
      "knew how she could bear it!\n",
      "\n",
      "These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded\n",
      "entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.\n",
      "They were relieved however, not by her own recollection,\n",
      "but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be\n",
      "inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her\n",
      "that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday,\n",
      "and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther\n",
      "by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme\n",
      "affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they\n",
      "were together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important Tuesday came that was to introduce\n",
      "the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they\n",
      "walked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived\n",
      "so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed\n",
      "the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody here but\n",
      "you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.\n",
      "Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all\n",
      "my happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could have given her immediate relief\n",
      "by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother,\n",
      "rather than her own, whom they were about to behold;\n",
      "but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with\n",
      "great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\n",
      "amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself,\n",
      "hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright,\n",
      "even to formality, in her figure, and serious,\n",
      "even to sourness, in her aspect.  Her complexion was sallow;\n",
      "and her features small, without beauty, and naturally\n",
      "without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow\n",
      "had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity,\n",
      "by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature.\n",
      "She was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people\n",
      "in general, she proportioned them to the number of\n",
      "her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\n",
      "not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed\n",
      "with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.--\n",
      "A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it\n",
      "was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now;--\n",
      "and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles,\n",
      "a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more,\n",

      "of both mother and daughter towards the very person--\n",

      "had they known as much as she did, they would have been most\n",
      "anxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively\n",
      "no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both.\n",
      "But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied,\n",
      "she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from\n",
      "which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions\n",
      "with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance,\n",
      "without thoroughly despising them all four.\n",

      "about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous,\n",
      "and every thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination\n",
      "for show, and the Master's ability to support it.\n",
      "In spite of the improvements and additions which were\n",
      "making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\n",
      "having once been within some thousand pounds of being\n",
      "obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom\n",
      "of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--\n",
      "no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--\n",
      "but there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood\n",
      "had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\n",
      "and his wife had still less.  But there was no peculiar\n",
      "disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with\n",

      "under one or other of these disqualifications for being\n",

      "\n",
      "When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room\n",
      "after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident,\n",
      "for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some\n",
      "variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\n",
      "and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one\n",
      "subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in,\n",
      "which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood,\n",

      "Had both the children been there, the affair might\n",
      "have been determined too easily by measuring them at once;\n",

      "for their age, and could not conceive that there could\n",
      "be the smallest difference in the world between them;\n",
      "and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it,\n",

      "\"They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?\" But then again,\n",

      "In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered\n",
      "enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among\n",

      "of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable as she\n",
      "was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--\n",
      "but the very moment I was introduced, there was such an\n",
      "affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say,\n",
      "she had quite took a fancy to me.  Now was not it so?--\n",

      "just the same--all sweetness and affability!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still\n",

      "for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood,\n",

      "too high.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment,\n",
      "if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me.  If she had only\n",

      "a word, and never after had took any notice of me,\n",

      "what I mean--if I had been treated in that forbidding\n",
      "sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair.\n",
      "I could not have stood it.  For where she DOES dislike,\n",

      "announcing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward's immediately walking in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each\n",
      "shewed that it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish;\n",
      "and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk\n",
      "out of the room again, as to advance farther into it.\n",
      "The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form,\n",
      "which they would each have been most anxious to avoid,\n",
      "had fallen on them.--They were not only all three together,\n",
      "but were together without the relief of any other person.\n",
      "The ladies recovered themselves first.  It was not Lucy's\n",
      "business to put herself forward, and the appearance of\n",
      "secrecy must still be kept up.  She could therefore only\n",
      "LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,\n",
      "said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she,\n",
      "for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she\n",
      "forced herself, after a moment's recollection,\n",
      "to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,\n",
      "and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\n",
      "improved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy,\n",
      "nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself,\n",
      "to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him,\n",
      "and that she had very much regretted being from home,\n",
      "when he called before in Berkeley Street.  She would\n",
      "not be frightened from paying him those attentions which,\n",
      "as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the\n",
      "observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them\n",
      "to be narrowly watching her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he\n",
      "had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still\n",
      "exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case\n",
      "rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare;\n",
      "for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor\n",
      "could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined\n",
      "to make no contribution to the comfort of the others,\n",
      "and would not say a word; and almost every thing that WAS\n",
      "said, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer\n",
      "all the information about her mother's health, their coming\n",
      "to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\n",
      "but never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon\n",
      "afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as\n",
      "to determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne,\n",
      "to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,\n",
      "and THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away\n",
      "several minutes on the landing-place, with the most\n",
      "high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.\n",
      "When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures\n",
      "of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into\n",
      "the drawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him\n",
      "was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself,\n",
      "and strongly spoken.  She met him with a hand that would\n",
      "be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great\n",
      "happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,\n",
      "but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he\n",
      "really felt.  Again they all sat down, and for a moment\n",
      "or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the\n",
      "most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes\n",
      "at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each\n",
      "other should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence.\n",
      "Edward was the first to speak, and it was to notice\n",
      "Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her\n",
      "not finding London agree with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't think of me!\" she replied with spirited\n",
      "earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears\n",
      "as she spoke, \"don't think of MY health.  Elinor is well,\n",
      "you see.  That must be enough for us both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This remark was not calculated to make Edward or\n",
      "Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy,\n",
      "who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say\n",
      "any thing that might introduce another subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it,\n",
      "but I have found none.  The sight of you, Edward, is the\n",
      "only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you\n",
      "are what you always were!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused--no one spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must\n",
      "employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton.\n",
      "In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust,\n",
      "Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was,\n",
      "nobody knew, not even himself.  But Marianne, who saw\n",
      "his agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever\n",
      "cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\n",
      "and soon talked of something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street\n",
      "yesterday!  So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much\n",
      "to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with this admirable discretion did she defer\n",
      "the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more\n",
      "disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly\n",
      "disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.\n",

      "some revenge on her, \"you think young men never stand\n",

      "little as well as great.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely\n",
      "insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very\n",
      "sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.\n",
      "And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience\n",
      "in the world; the most scrupulous in performing\n",
      "every engagement, however minute, and however it\n",
      "may make against his interest or pleasure.  He is the\n",
      "most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,\n",
      "and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body\n",
      "I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.\n",
      "What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you\n",
      "must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept\n",
      "of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nature of her commendation, in the present case,\n",
      "however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the\n",
      "feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very\n",
      "unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward,\n",
      "this must not be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And drawing him a little aside, she whispered\n",
      "her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer.\n",
      "But even this encouragement failed, for he would go;\n",
      "and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\n",
      "two hours, soon afterwards went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne,\n",
      "on her leaving them.  \"Could not she see that we wanted\n",
      "her gone!--how teazing to Edward!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been\n",

      "that he should like to see her as well as ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know,\n",
      "Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.\n",
      "If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted,\n",
      "as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect\n",
      "that I am the last person in the world to do it.\n",

      "would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences\n",

      "Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers\n",
      "announced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer,\n",
      "Esq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very\n",
      "interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all\n",
      "those intimate connections who knew it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness,\n",
      "produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time,\n",
      "and influenced, in a like degree, the engagements\n",
      "of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much\n",
      "as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning\n",
      "as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late\n",
      "in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular\n",
      "request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day,\n",
      "in every day in Conduit Street.  For their own comfort\n",
      "they would much rather have remained, at least all\n",
      "the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not\n",
      "a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.\n",
      "Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton\n",
      "and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact\n",
      "was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had too much sense to be desirable companions\n",
      "to the former; and by the latter they were considered with\n",
      "a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing\n",
      "the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.  Though nothing\n",
      "could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to\n",
      "Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\n",
      "Because they neither flattered herself nor her children,\n",
      "she could not believe them good-natured; and because they\n",
      "were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps\n",
      "without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;\n",
      "but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use,\n",
      "and easily given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.\n",
      "It checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.\n",
      "Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them,\n",
      "and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of\n",
      "and administer at other times, she feared they would despise\n",
      "her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed\n",
      "of the three, by their presence; and it was in their power\n",
      "to reconcile her to it entirely.  Would either of them\n",
      "only have given her a full and minute account of the whole\n",
      "affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would\n",
      "have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice\n",
      "of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\n",
      "arrival occasioned.  But this conciliation was not granted;\n",
      "for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her\n",
      "sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection\n",
      "on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect\n",
      "was produced, but a look of indifference from the former,\n",
      "or of disgust in the latter.  An effort even yet lighter\n",
      "might have made her their friend.  Would they only have\n",
      "laughed at her about the Doctor!  But so little were they,\n",
      "anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her,\n",
      "that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole\n",
      "day without hearing any other raillery on the subject,\n",
      "than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so\n",
      "totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought\n",
      "it a delightful thing for the girls to be together;\n",
      "and generally congratulated her young friends every night,\n",
      "on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.\n",
      "She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes\n",
      "at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came\n",

      "attributing Charlotte's well doing to her own care, and ready\n",
      "to give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation,\n",
      "as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\n",
      "One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her\n",
      "daily complaint.  Mr. Palmer maintained the common,\n",
      "but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike;\n",
      "and though she could plainly perceive, at different times,\n",
      "the most striking resemblance between this baby and every\n",
      "one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing\n",
      "his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it\n",
      "was not exactly like every other baby of the same age;\n",
      "nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple\n",
      "proposition of its being the finest child in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I come now to the relation of a misfortune,\n",
      "which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood.\n",
      "It so happened that while her two sisters with\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,\n",
      "another of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance\n",
      "in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.\n",
      "But while the imaginations of other people will carry\n",
      "them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,\n",
      "and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness\n",
      "must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.\n",
      "In the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed\n",
      "her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,\n",
      "that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods,\n",
      "and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters,\n",
      "she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street;\n",
      "and this misconstruction produced within a day\n",
      "or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them\n",
      "as well as for their brother and sister, to a small\n",
      "musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was,\n",
      "that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only\n",
      "to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her\n",
      "carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,\n",
      "must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\n",
      "to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they\n",
      "might not expect to go out with her a second time?  The power\n",
      "of disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's.\n",
      "But that was not enough; for when people are determined\n",
      "on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel\n",
      "injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much\n",
      "into the habit of going out every day, that it was become\n",
      "a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:\n",
      "and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every\n",
      "evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest\n",
      "amusement from any, and very often without knowing,\n",
      "till the last moment, where it was to take her.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly\n",
      "indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,\n",
      "during the whole of her toilet, which it received from\n",
      "Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being\n",
      "together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute\n",
      "observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,\n",
      "and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price\n",
      "of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the\n",
      "number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than\n",
      "Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out\n",
      "before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,\n",
      "and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\n",
      "The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,\n",
      "was generally concluded with a compliment, which\n",
      "though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne\n",
      "as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing\n",
      "an examination into the value and make of her gown,\n",
      "the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,\n",
      "she was almost sure of being told that upon \"her word\n",
      "she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would\n",
      "make a great many conquests.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed\n",
      "on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage;\n",
      "which they were ready to enter five minutes after it\n",
      "stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable\n",
      "to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\n",
      "of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay\n",
      "on their part that might inconvenience either herself\n",
      "or her coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The events of this evening were not very remarkable.\n",
      "The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a\n",
      "great many people who had real taste for the performance,\n",
      "and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers\n",
      "themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\n",
      "and that of their immediate friends, the first private\n",
      "performers in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,\n",
      "she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand\n",
      "pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even\n",
      "by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix\n",
      "them at pleasure on any other object in the room.  In one\n",
      "of these excursive glances she perceived among a group\n",
      "of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture\n",
      "on toothpick-cases at Gray's.  She perceived him soon\n",
      "afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly\n",
      "to her brother; and had just determined to find out his\n",
      "name from the latter, when they both came towards her,\n",
      "and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted\n",
      "his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as\n",
      "words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb\n",
      "she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy had\n",
      "it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended\n",
      "less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest\n",
      "relations!  For then his brother's bow must have given\n",
      "the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother\n",
      "and sister would have begun.  But while she wondered\n",
      "at the difference of the two young men, she did not find\n",
      "that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out\n",
      "of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.\n",
      "Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself\n",
      "in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation;\n",
      "for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\n",
      "GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing\n",
      "in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it\n",
      "much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune\n",
      "of a private education; while he himself, though probably\n",
      "without any particular, any material superiority\n",
      "by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\n",
      "was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more;\n",
      "and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving\n",
      "about it.  'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must\n",
      "make yourself easy.  The evil is now irremediable,\n",
      "and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would\n",
      "you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your\n",
      "own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,\n",
      "at the most critical time of his life?  If you had only sent\n",
      "him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending\n",
      "him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.'\n",
      "This is the way in which I always consider the matter,\n",
      "and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because,\n",
      "whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage\n",
      "of a public school, she could not think of Edward's\n",
      "abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his\n",
      "next observation, \"in a cottage near Dawlish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor set him right as to its situation;\n",
      "and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody\n",
      "could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.\n",
      "He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\n",
      "species of house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond\n",
      "of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much\n",
      "elegance about them.  And I protest, if I had any money\n",
      "to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,\n",
      "within a short distance of London, where I might drive\n",
      "myself down at any time, and collect a few friends\n",
      "about me, and be happy.  I advise every body who is going\n",
      "to build, to build a cottage.  My friend Lord Courtland\n",
      "came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\n",
      "and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.\n",
      "I was to decide on the best of them.  'My dear Courtland,'\n",
      "said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, 'do not\n",
      "adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.'\n",
      "And that I fancy, will be the end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,\n",
      "no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.\n",
      "I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford.\n",
      "Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  'But how can it\n",
      "be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it\n",
      "is to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage\n",
      "that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?'\n",
      "I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,\n",
      "so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.\n",
      "The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\n",
      "card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library\n",
      "may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the\n",
      "supper be set out in the saloon.'  Lady Elliott was delighted\n",
      "with the thought.  We measured the dining-room, and found\n",
      "it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair\n",
      "was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact,\n",
      "you see, if people do but know how to set about it,\n",
      "every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage\n",
      "as in the most spacious dwelling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think\n",
      "he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his\n",
      "eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on\n",
      "any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,\n",
      "which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,\n",
      "when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's\n",
      "mistake,\n",
      "in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the\n",
      "propriety of their being really invited to become such,\n",
      "while Mrs. Jenning's engagements kept her from home.\n",
      "The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;\n",
      "and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy\n",
      "of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its\n",
      "complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.\n",
      "Fanny was startled at the proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she,\n",
      "\"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day\n",
      "with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.\n",
      "You know I am always ready to pay them any attention\n",
      "in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.\n",
      "But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them\n",
      "away from her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband, but with great humility, did not see\n",
      "the force of her objection.  \"They had already spent a week\n",
      "in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton\n",
      "could not be displeased at their giving the same number\n",
      "of days to such near relations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it\n",
      "was in my power.  But I had just settled within myself\n",
      "to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.\n",
      "They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think\n",
      "the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\n",
      "well by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year,\n",
      "you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.\n",
      "I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,\n",
      "you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they\n",
      "are such favourites with Harry!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity\n",
      "of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience\n",

      "another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting\n",

      "This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;\n",
      "cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!\n",

      "Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,\n",
      "that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up\n",
      "the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with\n",
      "visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period\n",
      "to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found\n",
      "the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the third or fourth morning after their\n",
      "being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,\n",
      "entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting\n",
      "by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance\n",
      "as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her\n",
      "time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,\n",
      "by saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, ma'am.  What is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.--\n",
      "When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite\n",
      "in a fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very\n",
      "ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\n",
      "So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,'\n",
      "says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--'\n",
      "and nurse said just the same.  But Charlotte, she would\n",
      "not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily\n",
      "he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\n",
      "stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,\n",
      "be said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world\n",
      "but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.  And so,\n",
      "just as he was going away again, it came into my head,\n",
      "I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,\n",
      "but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.\n",
      "So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,\n",
      "and seemed to know something or other, and at last he\n",
      "said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report\n",
      "should reach the young ladies under your care as to their\n",
      "sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say,\n",
      "that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! is Fanny ill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  'Lord!' says I,\n",
      "'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the\n",
      "long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,\n",
      "seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young\n",
      "man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\n",
      "turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing\n",
      "in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged\n",
      "above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you,\n",
      "my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,\n",
      "except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--\n",
      "There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\n",
      "but that matters should be brought so forward between them,\n",
      "and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened\n",
      "to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it\n",
      "out directly.  Well, and so this was kept a great secret,\n",
      "for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your\n",
      "brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--\n",
      "till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a\n",
      "well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.\n",
      "'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond\n",
      "of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'\n",
      "and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all\n",
      "alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to\n",
      "come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five\n",
      "minutes before, that she thought to make a match between\n",
      "Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who.\n",
      "So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity\n",
      "and pride.  She fell into violent hysterics immediately,\n",
      "with such screams as reached your brother's ears,\n",
      "as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,\n",
      "thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.\n",
      "So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,\n",
      "for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\n",
      "what was going on.  Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say,\n",
      "I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded\n",
      "like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.\n",
      "Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;\n",
      "and your brother, he walked about the room, and said\n",
      "he did not know what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared\n",
      "they should not stay a minute longer in the house,\n",
      "and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,\n",
      "to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed\n",
      "up their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again,\n",
      "and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\n",
      "and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.\n",
      "The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor\n",
      "cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he\n",
      "came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\n",
      "she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.\n",
      "I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,\n",
      "with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.\n",
      "Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he\n",
      "hears of it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for\n",
      "they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.\n",
      "I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\n",
      "passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I\n",
      "had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,\n",
      "that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may\n",
      "be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she\n",
      "was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,\n",
      "for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;\n",
      "and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for\n",
      "either of them.  I have no notion of people's making\n",
      "such a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no\n",
      "reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;\n",
      "for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well\n",
      "by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,\n",
      "she knows better than any body how to make the most\n",
      "of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only\n",
      "allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good\n",
      "an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.\n",
      "Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage\n",
      "as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;\n",
      "and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my\n",
      "Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them\n",
      "exactly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had\n",
      "time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able\n",
      "to give such an answer, and make such observations,\n",
      "as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.\n",
      "Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\n",
      "interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late\n",
      "often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her\n",
      "at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,\n",
      "in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able\n",
      "to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to\n",
      "give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality\n",
      "on the conduct of every one concerned in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could hardly determine what her own expectation\n",
      "of its event really was; though she earnestly tried\n",
      "to drive away the notion of its being possible to end\n",
      "otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.\n",
      "What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could\n",
      "not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;\n",
      "and still more anxious to know how Edward would\n",
      "conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much compassion;--\n",
      "for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure\n",
      "that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,\n",
      "Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for\n",
      "its discussion.  No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,\n",
      "in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in\n",
      "endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\n",
      "without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,\n",
      "or any resentment against Edward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going\n",
      "to remove what she really believed to be her sister's\n",
      "chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she\n",
      "feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and\n",
      "to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,\n",
      "which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\n",
      "disappointment over again.  But unwelcome as such a task\n",
      "must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore\n",
      "hastened to perform it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own\n",
      "feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,\n",
      "any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised\n",
      "since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might\n",
      "suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\n",
      "Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could\n",
      "not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied\n",
      "by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged\n",
      "rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,\n",
      "and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the comforter\n",
      "of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;\n",
      "and all the comfort that could be given by assurances\n",
      "of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest\n",
      "vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,\n",
      "was readily offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.\n",
      "Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging\n",
      "as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,\n",
      "could she feel less than herself!  As for Lucy Steele,\n",
      "she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\n",
      "incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could\n",
      "not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards\n",
      "to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.\n",
      "She would not even admit it to have been natural;\n",
      "and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,\n",
      "by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge\n",
      "of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first communication had reached no farther than\n",
      "to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time\n",
      "it had existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in,\n",
      "and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some\n",
      "time all that could be done was to soothe her distress,\n",
      "lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first\n",
      "question on her side, which led to farther particulars,\n",
      "was,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has\n",
      "he written to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy\n",
      "first came to Barton Park last November, she told me\n",
      "in confidence of her engagement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment\n",
      "which her lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder,\n",
      "she exclaimed--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor confirmed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this\n",
      "been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being\n",
      "happy!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not fit that you should then know how much\n",
      "I was the reverse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four months!\"--cried Marianne again.--\"So calm!--\n",
      "so cheerful!--how have you been supported?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to\n",
      "Lucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore,\n",
      "to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my\n",
      "family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,\n",
      "which it could not be in my power to satisfy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne seemed much struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my\n",
      "mother,\" added Elinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it;--\n",
      "but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort\n",
      "of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing\n",
      "how much I felt.  Now, I can think and speak of it with\n",
      "little emotion.  I would not have you suffer on my account;\n",
      "for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.\n",
      "I have many things to support me.  I am not conscious of having\n",
      "provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,\n",
      "I have borne it as much as possible without spreading\n",
      "it farther.  I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.\n",
      "I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always\n",
      "doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,\n",
      "in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,\n",
      "and that is the foundation on which every thing good may\n",
      "be built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is\n",
      "bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,\n",
      "and all that can be said of one's happiness depending\n",
      "entirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it\n",
      "is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--\n",
      "Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior\n",
      "in person and understanding to half her sex; and time\n",
      "and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\n",
      "another superior to HER.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne,\n",
      "\"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily\n",
      "to be made up by something else, your resolution,\n",
      "your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\n",
      "wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever\n",
      "felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this\n",
      "hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak\n",
      "of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make\n",
      "you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\n",
      "to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--\n",
      "It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the\n",
      "very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all\n",
      "my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.--\n",
      "This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose,\n",
      "by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\n",
      "deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have\n",
      "had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--\n",
      "I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,\n",
      "without hearing one circumstance that could make me less\n",
      "desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;\n",
      "nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--\n",
      "I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,\n",
      "and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the\n",
      "punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--\n",
      "And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you\n",
      "know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--\n",
      "If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you\n",
      "may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure\n",
      "of mind with which I have brought myself at present\n",
      "to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been\n",
      "willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and\n",
      "painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--\n",
      "they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--\n",
      "No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,\n",
      "perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I\n",
      "owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was\n",
      "VERY unhappy.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was quite subdued.--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate\n",
      "myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--\n",
      "you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me\n",
      "in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering\n",
      "for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I\n",
      "can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself,\n",
      "I have been trying to do it away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The tenderest caresses followed this confession.\n",
      "In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had\n",
      "no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise\n",
      "she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\n",
      "never to speak of the affair to any one with the least\n",
      "appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying\n",
      "the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see\n",
      "Edward himself, if chance should bring them together,\n",
      "without any diminution of her usual cordiality.--\n",
      "These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt\n",
      "that she had injured, no reparation could be too much\n",
      "for her to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "She performed her promise of being discreet,\n",
      "to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion,\n",
      "dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three\n",
      "times to say, \"Yes, ma'am.\"--She listened to her praise\n",
      "of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another,\n",
      "and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's affection,\n",
      "it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances\n",
      "towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal\n",
      "to any thing herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning brought a farther trial of it,\n",
      "in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious\n",
      "aspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them\n",
      "news of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity,\n",
      "as soon as he was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery\n",
      "that took place under our roof yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful\n",
      "a moment for speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such\n",
      "complicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may\n",
      "be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome.\n",
      "Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.\n",
      "But I would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there\n",
      "is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution\n",
      "is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing.\n",
      "She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!\n",
      "She says she never shall think well of anybody again;\n",
      "and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--\n",
      "meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness\n",
      "had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!  It\n",
      "was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she\n",
      "had asked these young women to her house; merely because\n",
      "she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\n",
      "well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions;\n",
      "for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you\n",
      "and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there,\n",
      "was attending her daughter.  And now to be so rewarded!\n",
      "'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her\n",
      "affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead\n",
      "of them.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done,\n",
      "he went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny\n",
      "broke it to her, is not to be described.  While she with\n",
      "the truest affection had been planning a most eligible\n",
      "connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could\n",
      "be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such\n",
      "a suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she\n",
      "suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be\n",
      "in THAT quarter.  'THERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might\n",
      "have thought myself safe.' She was quite in an agony.\n",
      "We consulted together, however, as to what should be done,\n",
      "and at last she determined to send for Edward.\n",
      "He came.  But I am sorry to relate what ensued.\n",
      "All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end\n",
      "to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\n",
      "by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of\n",
      "no avail.  Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.\n",
      "I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.\n",
      "His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case\n",
      "of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on\n",
      "him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings\n",
      "in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\n",
      "grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition\n",
      "to this, if he still persisted in this low connection,\n",
      "represented to him the certain penury that must attend\n",
      "the match.  His own two thousand pounds she protested\n",
      "should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far\n",
      "would she be from affording him the smallest assistance,\n",
      "that if he were to enter into any profession with a view\n",
      "of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent\n",
      "him advancing in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,\n",
      "clapped her hands together, and cried, \"Gracious God!\n",
      "can this be possible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother,\n",
      "\"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.\n",
      "Your exclamation is very natural.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered\n",
      "her promises, and forbore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain.\n",
      "Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in\n",
      "the most determined manner.  Nothing should prevail on\n",
      "him to give up his engagement.  He would stand to it,\n",
      "cost him what it might.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,\n",
      "no longer able to be silent, \"he has acted like an honest\n",
      "man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had\n",
      "done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.\n",
      "I have some little concern in the business, as well\n",
      "as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe\n",
      "there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one\n",
      "who more deserves a good husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature\n",
      "was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished\n",
      "to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.\n",
      "He therefore replied, without any resentment,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any\n",
      "relation of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,\n",
      "a very deserving young woman, but in the present case\n",
      "you know, the connection must be impossible.\n",
      "And to have entered into a secret engagement with a\n",
      "young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman\n",
      "especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,\n",
      "is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,\n",
      "I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person\n",
      "whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish\n",
      "her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout\n",
      "the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,\n",
      "in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has been dignified\n",
      "and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear\n",
      "it will be a bad one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension;\n",
      "and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,\n",
      "while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could\n",
      "not reward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--\n",
      "Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.\n",
      "He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether\n",
      "he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can\n",
      "make no inquiry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, indeed, ma'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.\n",
      "Born to the prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive\n",
      "a situation more deplorable.  The interest of two thousand\n",
      "pounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added\n",
      "the recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,\n",
      "within three months have been in the receipt of two\n",
      "thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has\n",
      "thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself\n",
      "a more wretched condition.  We must all feel for him;\n",
      "and the more so, because it is totally out of our power\n",
      "to assist him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure\n",
      "he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;\n",
      "and so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is not fit\n",
      "that he should be living about at his own charge now,\n",
      "at lodgings and taverns.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward,\n",
      "though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\"\n",
      "said John Dashwood, \"as all his friends were disposed to do\n",
      "by him, he might now have been in his proper situation,\n",
      "and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it is, it must\n",
      "be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is one\n",
      "thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than\n",
      "all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind\n",
      "of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,\n",
      "which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions.\n",
      "I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over\n",
      "the business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is HER revenge.\n",
      "Everybody has a way of their own.  But I don't think mine\n",
      "would be, to make one son independent, because another had\n",
      "plagued me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne got up and walked about the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\"\n",
      "continued John, \"than to see his younger brother in\n",
      "possession of an estate which might have been his own?\n",
      "Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion,\n",
      "concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his\n",
      "sisters that he really believed there was no material\n",
      "danger in Fanny's indisposition, and that they need\n",
      "not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\n",
      "leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments\n",
      "on the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he\n",
      "quitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve\n",
      "impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 38\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's\n",
      "conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its\n",
      "true merit.  THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt\n",
      "him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,\n",
      "beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could\n",
      "remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.\n",
      "Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all\n",
      "his offences in compassion for his punishment.  But though\n",
      "confidence between them was, by this public discovery,\n",
      "restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on\n",
      "which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.\n",
      "Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still\n",
      "more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive\n",
      "assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued\n",
      "affection for herself which she rather wished to do away;\n",
      "and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying\n",
      "to converse upon a topic which always left her more\n",
      "dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison\n",
      "it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt all the force of that comparison; but not\n",
      "as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;\n",
      "she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,\n",
      "regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted\n",
      "herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\n",
      "without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened\n",
      "that she still fancied present exertion impossible,\n",
      "and therefore it only dispirited her more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,\n",
      "of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.\n",
      "But though so much of the matter was known to them already,\n",
      "that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading\n",
      "that knowledge farther, without seeking after more,\n",
      "she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\n",
      "and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;\n",
      "and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,\n",
      "had prevented her going to them within that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third day succeeding their knowledge of the\n",
      "particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw\n",
      "many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second\n",
      "week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;\n",
      "but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again\n",
      "in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,\n",
      "chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public\n",
      "a place.\n",
      "\n",
      "An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined\n",
      "them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was\n",
      "not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging\n",
      "all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left\n",
      "to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\n",
      "nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody\n",
      "who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting\n",
      "to her.  But at last she found herself with some surprise,\n",
      "accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,\n",
      "expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving\n",
      "encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "left her own party for a short time, to join their's.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you\n",
      "any thing if you ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity\n",
      "and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT\n",
      "being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele,\n",
      "taking her familiarly by the arm--\"for I wanted to see you\n",
      "of all things in the world.\"  And then lowering her voice,\n",
      "\"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.\n",
      "Is she angry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have\n",
      "had such a time of it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage\n",
      "in my life.  She vowed at first she would never trim me\n",
      "up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,\n",
      "so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,\n",
      "and we are as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me\n",
      "this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.\n",
      "There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too.  But why\n",
      "should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS\n",
      "the Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part,\n",
      "I should never have known he DID like it better than\n",
      "any other colour, if he had not happened to say so.\n",
      "My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare sometimes\n",
      "I do not know which way to look before them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor\n",
      "had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient\n",
      "to find her way back again to the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, but Miss Dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly,\n",
      "\"people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's\n",
      "declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing\n",
      "I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured\n",
      "reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think\n",
      "about it herself, you know, it was no business of other\n",
      "people to set it down for certain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,\n",
      "I assure you,\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well,\n",
      "and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,\n",
      "that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars\n",
      "to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand\n",
      "pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had\n",
      "nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.\n",
      "And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,\n",
      "that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars\n",
      "would be off; and when Edward did not come near us\n",
      "for three days, I could not tell what to think myself;\n",
      "and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;\n",
      "for we came away from your brother's Wednesday,\n",
      "and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,\n",
      "and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.\n",
      "Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits\n",
      "rose against that.  However this morning he came just\n",
      "as we came home from church; and then it all came out,\n",
      "how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\n",
      "and been talked to by his mother and all of them,\n",
      "and how he had declared before them all that he loved\n",
      "nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.\n",
      "And how he had been so worried by what passed,\n",
      "that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,\n",
      "he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,\n",
      "some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn\n",
      "all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better\n",
      "of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again,\n",
      "he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\n",
      "and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep\n",
      "her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,\n",
      "for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope\n",
      "of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,\n",
      "as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,\n",
      "and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear\n",
      "to think of her doing no better, and so he begged,\n",
      "if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the\n",
      "matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.\n",
      "I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\n",
      "And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,\n",
      "that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.\n",
      "I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being\n",
      "tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any\n",
      "thing like it.  But, to be sure, Lucy would not give\n",
      "ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly\n",
      "(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,\n",
      "and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things\n",
      "you know)--she told him directly, she had not the least\n",
      "mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him\n",
      "upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,\n",
      "she should be very glad to have it all, you know,\n",
      "or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy,\n",
      "and talked on some time about what they should do,\n",
      "and they agreed he should take orders directly,\n",
      "and they must wait to be married till he got a living.\n",
      "And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\n",
      "called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in\n",
      "her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;\n",
      "so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,\n",
      "to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not\n",
      "care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put\n",
      "on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\"\n",
      "said Elinor; \"you were all in the same room together,\n",
      "were not you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you\n",
      "think people make love when any body else is by?  Oh,\n",
      "for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.\n",
      "(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the\n",
      "drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening\n",
      "at the door.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than\n",
      "two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone\n",
      "increased every day.  She sighed for the air, the liberty,\n",
      "the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place\n",
      "could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly\n",
      "less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much\n",
      "less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she\n",
      "was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,\n",
      "which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.\n",
      "She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards\n",
      "its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes\n",
      "to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the\n",
      "eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,\n",
      "which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks\n",
      "longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible\n",
      "than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland\n",
      "about the end of March, for the Easter holidays;\n",
      "and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very\n",
      "warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.  This would\n",
      "not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of\n",
      "Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real\n",
      "politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very\n",
      "great amendment of his manners towards them since her\n",
      "sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept\n",
      "it with pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she told Marianne what she had done, however,\n",
      "her first reply was not very auspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation.\n",
      "\"No, I cannot go to Cleveland.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation\n",
      "is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go\n",
      "into Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward\n",
      "to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming\n",
      "such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by\n",
      "working on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure\n",
      "which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,\n",
      "whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,\n",
      "more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,\n",
      "and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland,\n",
      "which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to\n",
      "Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey;\n",
      "and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend\n",
      "them down; and as there could be no occasion of their\n",
      "staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at\n",
      "home in little more than three weeks' time.  As Marianne's\n",
      "affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph\n",
      "with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest,\n",
      "that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again\n",
      "from Cleveland.  Elinor was grateful for the attention,\n",
      "but it could not alter her design; and their mother's\n",
      "concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative\n",
      "to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--\n",
      "and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement\n",
      "of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall\n",
      "do without the Miss Dashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "address to him when he first called on her, after their\n",
      "leaving her was settled--\"for they are quite resolved\n",
      "upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we\n",
      "shall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape\n",
      "at one another as dull as two cats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous\n",
      "sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make\n",
      "that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--\n",
      "and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think\n",
      "her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window\n",
      "to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,\n",
      "which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed\n",
      "her to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed\n",
      "with her there for several minutes.  The effect of his\n",
      "discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,\n",
      "for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\n",
      "changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear,\n",
      "to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne\n",
      "was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing\n",
      "that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,\n",
      "and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--\n",
      "Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval\n",
      "of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another,\n",
      "some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear,\n",
      "in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness\n",
      "of his house.  This set the matter beyond a doubt.\n",
      "She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary\n",
      "to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.\n",
      "What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,\n",
      "but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did\n",
      "not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "commended her in her heart for being so honest.\n",
      "They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her\n",
      "catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne's\n",
      "performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm voice,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech,\n",
      "she was almost ready to cry out, \"Lord! what should\n",
      "hinder it?\"--but checking her desire, confined herself\n",
      "to this silent ejaculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not\n",
      "seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,\n",
      "for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,\n",
      "and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard\n",
      "Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude,\n",
      "and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,\n",
      "the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he\n",
      "immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away\n",
      "without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old\n",
      "friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "What had really passed between them was to this effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion,\n",
      "\"of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered\n",
      "from his family; for if I understand the matter right,\n",
      "he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\n",
      "in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.--\n",
      "Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor told him that it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied,\n",
      "with great feeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide,\n",
      "two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what\n",
      "she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr. Ferrars two\n",
      "or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased\n",
      "with him.  He is not a young man with whom one can\n",
      "be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have\n",
      "seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,\n",
      "and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.\n",
      "I understand that he intends to take orders.  Will you\n",
      "be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,\n",
      "now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post,\n",
      "is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,\n",
      "perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,\n",
      "it may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it\n",
      "were more  valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;\n",
      "the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than\n",
      "200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable\n",
      "of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as\n",
      "to afford him a very comfortable income.  Such as it is,\n",
      "however, my pleasure in presenting him to it,\n",
      "will be very great.  Pray assure him of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's astonishment at this commission could\n",
      "hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really\n",
      "making her an offer of his hand.  The preferment,\n",
      "which only two days before she had considered as hopeless\n",
      "for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--\n",
      "and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to\n",
      "bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had\n",
      "attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor\n",
      "feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share\n",
      "in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,\n",
      "and her gratitude for the particular friendship,\n",
      "which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,\n",
      "were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  She thanked him\n",
      "for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and\n",
      "disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;\n",
      "and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,\n",
      "if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\n",
      "to another.  But at the same time, she could not help\n",
      "thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.\n",
      "It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\n",
      "Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,\n",
      "she would have been very glad to be spared herself;--\n",
      "but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,\n",
      "declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being\n",
      "given through her means, that she would not on any account\n",
      "make farther opposition.  Edward, she believed, was still in\n",
      "town,\n",
      "and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.\n",
      "She could undertake therefore to inform him of it,\n",
      "in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,\n",
      "Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage\n",
      "in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,\n",
      "and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the\n",
      "house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an't the least\n",

      "\"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that,\n",

      "the evening; for we shall be quite alone.  I do not ask\n",
      "you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full\n",
      "of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\n",

      "\"No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please.\n",
      "One day's delay will not be very material; and till I\n",
      "have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be\n",
      "mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.\n",
      "It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\n",

      "in such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend.\n",
      "A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,\n",
      "and she exclaimed;--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be\n",
      "the man.  Well, so much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure,\n",
      "he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad\n",
      "to find things are so forward between you.  But, my dear,\n",
      "is not this rather out of character?  Should not the Colonel\n",
      "write himself?--sure, he is the proper person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather\n",
      "wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars\n",
      "than himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd\n",
      "kind of delicacy!  However, I will not disturb you (seeing\n",
      "her preparing to write.)  You know your own concerns best.\n",
      "So goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of any thing to\n",
      "please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "can't tell.  She is an excellent housemaid, and works\n",
      "very well at her needle.  However, you will think of all\n",
      "that at your leisure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, ma'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing\n",
      "much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,\n",
      "than to be mistress of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "How she should begin--how she should express\n",
      "herself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern.\n",
      "The particular circumstances between them made\n",
      "a difficulty of that which to any other person would\n",
      "have been the easiest thing in the world; but she\n",
      "equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat\n",
      "deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,\n",
      "till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to\n",

      "after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged\n",
      "him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,\n",
      "and wanted to speak with him on very particular business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had just been congratulating herself,\n",
      "in the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it\n",
      "might be to express herself properly by letter, it was\n",
      "at least preferable to giving the information by word\n",
      "of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this\n",
      "greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion\n",
      "were very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had\n",
      "not seen him before since his engagement became public,\n",
      "and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted\n",
      "with it; which, with the consciousness of what she\n",
      "had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,\n",
      "made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.\n",
      "He too was much distressed; and they sat down together\n",
      "in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he\n",
      "had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming\n",
      "into the room, he could not recollect; but determining\n",
      "to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form\n",
      "as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished\n",
      "to speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I\n",
      "certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;\n",
      "though at the same time, I should have been extremely\n",
      "sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\n",
      "especially as it will most likely be some time--it\n",
      "is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure\n",
      "of meeting you again.  I go to Oxford tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor,\n",
      "recovering herself, and determined to get over what she\n",
      "so much dreaded as soon as possible, \"without receiving\n",
      "our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them\n",
      "in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said.\n",
      "I have something of consequence to inform you of,\n",
      "which I was on the point of communicating by paper.\n",
      "I am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing\n",
      "rather faster than usual as she spoke.)  Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say,\n",
      "that understanding you mean to take orders, he has\n",
      "great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford\n",
      "now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.\n",
      "Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable\n",
      "and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\n",
      "the living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much\n",
      "more considerable, and such as might better enable you\n",
      "to--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to\n",
      "yourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views\n",
      "of happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself,\n",
      "it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him.\n",
      "He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected,\n",
      "such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;\n",
      "but he said only these two words,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution,\n",
      "as some of the worst was over, \"Colonel Brandon means\n",
      "it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately\n",
      "passed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable\n",
      "conduct of your family has placed you--a concern\n",
      "which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends,\n",
      "must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem\n",

      "\"No,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to\n",
      "find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you,\n",
      "to your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express\n",
      "it if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you\n",
      "that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely,\n",
      "to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment\n",
      "of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,\n",
      "till I understood his design, that the living was vacant;\n",
      "nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have\n",
      "had such a living in his gift.  As a friend of mine,\n",
      "of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,\n",
      "still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,\n",
      "you owe nothing to my solicitation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share\n",
      "in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling\n",
      "to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged\n",
      "it with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix\n",
      "that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.\n",
      "For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased\n",
      "to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.\n",
      "I have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother\n",
      "I know esteems him highly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man,\n",
      "and in his manners perfectly the gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him,\n",
      "on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,\n",
      "and as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand\n",
      "the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,)\n",
      "it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward made no answer; but when she had turned\n",
      "away her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest,\n",
      "so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish\n",
      "the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house\n",
      "much greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\"\n",
      "said he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor told him the number of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks\n",
      "which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him\n",
      "that he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted,\n",
      "with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing\n",
      "good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation\n",
      "that might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to\n",
      "return the same good will, than the power of expressing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself,\n",
      "as the door shut him out, \"I shall see him the husband\n",
      "of Lucy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down\n",
      "to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour\n",
      "to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course,\n",
      "to reflect on her own with discontent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned\n",
      "from seeing people whom she had never seen before,\n",
      "and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,\n",
      "her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret\n",
      "in her possession, than by anything else, that she\n",
      "reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up to the\n",
      "young man.  Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had\n",
      "no great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling\n",
      "to accept your proposal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems\n",
      "all to depend upon that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really,\" said Elinor, \"I know so little of these kind\n",
      "of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time,\n",
      "or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three\n",
      "months will complete his ordination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two or three months!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"Lord! my dear,\n",
      "how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two\n",
      "or three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME\n",
      "quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad\n",
      "to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is\n",
      "not worth while to wait two or three months for him.\n",
      "Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well;\n",
      "somebody that is in orders already.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear ma'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of?--\n",
      "Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade\n",
      "me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving\n",
      "ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The deception could not continue after this;\n",
      "and an explanation immediately took place, by which both\n",
      "gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any\n",
      "material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still\n",
      "without forfeiting her expectation of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she,\n",
      "after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction\n",
      "was over, \"and very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear\n",
      "a man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my\n",
      "knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I\n",
      "think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--\n",
      "and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!--\n",
      "It seems quite ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must\n",
      "touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,\n",
      "and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two\n",
      "thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry\n",

      "be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas;\n",
      "and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there.\"\n",

      "from her companions.  Marianne, not contented with\n",
      "absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent\n",
      "to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "though her carriage was always at Elinor's service,\n",
      "so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her\n",
      "curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery,\n",
      "nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part,\n",
      "could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.\n",
      "The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself\n",
      "to pay a visit, for which no one could really have\n",
      "less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete\n",
      "with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much\n",
      "reason to dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could\n",
      "turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out.\n",
      "He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her\n",
      "that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street,\n",
      "and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her,\n",
      "invited her to come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\" said he:--\"I\n",
      "will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not\n",
      "have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.--\n",
      "Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there\n",
      "cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always\n",
      "great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor made what excuse she could for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied,\n",
      "\"for I have a good deal to say to you.  This living\n",
      "of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has he really given\n",
      "it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\n",
      "coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given\n",
      "the living of Delaford to Edward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no\n",
      "relationship!--no connection between them!--and now\n",
      "that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About two hundred a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well--and for the next presentation to a living\n",
      "of that value--supposing the late incumbent to have\n",
      "been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he\n",
      "might have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.\n",
      "And how came he not to have settled that matter before this\n",
      "person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it,\n",
      "but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should\n",
      "be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural,\n",
      "concern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal\n",
      "of inconsistency in almost every human character.  I suppose,\n",
      "however--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS.\n",
      "Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom\n",
      "the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough\n",
      "to take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively;\n",
      "and by relating that she had herself been employed\n",
      "in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward,\n",
      "and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it\n",
      "was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing\n",
      "what she said--\"what could be the Colonel's motive?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be,\n",
      "Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter\n",
      "to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her,\n",
      "and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear\n",
      "it much talked of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing,\n",
      "that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure,\n",
      "an acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither\n",
      "she nor her child could be possibly impoverished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the\n",
      "tone becoming so important a subject, \"knows nothing\n",
      "about it at present, and I believe it will be best to\n",
      "keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.--\n",
      "When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear\n",
      "of it all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why should such precaution be used?--Though\n",
      "it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have\n",
      "the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has\n",
      "money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite\n",
      "out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour,\n",
      "is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her\n",
      "son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those\n",
      "over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.\n",
      "Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable\n",
      "to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--\n",
      "she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.--\n",
      "She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort\n",
      "of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good,\n",
      "but it is founded on ignorance of human nature.\n",
      "When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend upon it\n",
      "his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;\n",
      "and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that\n",
      "dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly\n",
      "have escaped her memory by THIS time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one\n",
      "of the most affectionate mothers in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We think NOW,\"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause,\n",
      "\"of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance\n",
      "of her brother's tone, calmly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Choice!--how do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner\n",
      "of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether\n",
      "she marry Edward or Robert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert\n",
      "will now to all intents and purposes be considered\n",
      "as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are\n",
      "both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one\n",
      "is superior to the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short\n",
      "time silent.--His reflections ended thus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of ONE thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand,\n",
      "and speaking in an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you;--\n",
      "and I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you.\n",
      "I have good reason to think--indeed I have it from the\n",
      "best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise\n",
      "it would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but\n",
      "I have it from the very best authority--not that I ever\n",
      "precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her\n",
      "daughter DID, and I have it from her--That in short,\n",
      "whatever objections there might be against a certain--a\n",
      "certain connection--you understand me--it would have been\n",
      "far preferable to her, it would not have given her half\n",
      "the vexation that THIS does.  I was exceedingly pleased\n",
      "to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light--\n",
      "a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.\n",
      "'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least\n",
      "evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW\n",
      "for nothing worse.' But however, all that is quite out\n",
      "of the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--\n",
      "as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all\n",
      "that is gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you\n",
      "of this, because I knew how much it must please you.\n",
      "Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor.  There\n",
      "is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well,\n",
      "or better, perhaps, all things considered.  Has Colonel\n",
      "Brandon been with you lately?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity,\n",
      "and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves\n",
      "and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be\n",
      "spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself,\n",
      "and from the danger of hearing any thing more from\n",
      "her brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.\n",
      "After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that\n",
      "Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there,\n",
      "quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left\n",
      "to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the\n",
      "gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner\n",
      "while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love\n",
      "and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother,\n",
      "earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that\n",
      "brother's integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable\n",
      "opinion of his head and heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves,\n",
      "before he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard\n",
      "of the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject.\n",
      "Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them\n",
      "to John; and their effect on Robert, though very different,\n",
      "was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed\n",
      "most immoderately.  The idea of Edward's being a clergyman,\n",
      "and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him\n",
      "beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful\n",
      "imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice,\n",
      "and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and\n",
      "Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable\n",
      "gravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain\n",
      "her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke\n",
      "all the contempt it excited.  It was a look, however,\n",
      "very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave\n",
      "no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\n",
      "not by any reproof of her's, but by his own sensibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We may treat it as a joke,\" said he, at last,\n",
      "recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably\n",
      "lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--\"but, upon\n",
      "my soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor Edward!\n",
      "he is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for it--\n",
      "for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as\n",
      "well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world.\n",
      "You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR\n",
      "slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly\n",
      "not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born,\n",
      "you know, with the same powers,--the same address.--\n",
      "Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--\n",
      "to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul,\n",
      "I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;\n",
      "and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my\n",
      "life, as when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.--\n",
      "My mother was the first person who told me of it;\n",
      "and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,\n",
      "immediately said to her, 'My dear madam, I do not know\n",
      "what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself,\n",
      "I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman,\n",
      "I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.--\n",
      "I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has\n",
      "done for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from\n",
      "all decent society!--but, as I directly said to my mother,\n",
      "I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style\n",
      "of education, it was always to be expected.  My poor mother\n",
      "was half frantic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you ever seen the lady?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house,\n",
      "I happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw\n",
      "quite enough of her.  The merest awkward country girl,\n",
      "without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--\n",
      "I remember her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I\n",
      "should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward.\n",
      "I offered immediately, as soon as my mother related\n",
      "the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade\n",
      "him from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found,\n",
      "to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way\n",
      "at first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach\n",
      "had taken place, when it was not for me, you know,\n",
      "to interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few\n",
      "hours earlier--I think it is most probable--that something\n",
      "might have been hit on.  I certainly should have represented\n",
      "it to Edward in a very strong light.  'My dear fellow,'\n",
      "I should have said, 'consider what you are doing.\n",
      "You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one\n",
      "as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot\n",
      "help thinking, in short, that means might have been found.\n",
      "But now it is all too late.  He must be starved, you know;--\n",
      "that is certain; absolutely starved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had just settled this point with great composure,\n",
      "when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family,\n",
      "Elinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something\n",
      "like confusion of countenance with which she entered,\n",
      "and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.\n",
      "She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find\n",
      "that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town,\n",
      "as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion\n",
      "in which her husband, who attended her into the room,\n",
      "and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish\n",

      "so far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel\n",
      "Brandon's being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two,\n",
      "completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters\n",
      "in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come\n",
      "to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way,\n",
      "which of all things was the most unlikely to occur,\n",
      "with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John\n",
      "to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come\n",

      "It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed\n",
      "determined to send her to Delaford;--a place, in which,\n",
      "of all others, she would now least chuse to visit,\n",
      "or wish to reside; for not only was it considered as\n",
      "her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy,\n",
      "when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day,\n",
      "the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set\n",
      "out from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment,\n",
      "on the road.  For the convenience of Charlotte and her child,\n",
      "they were to be more than two days on their journey,\n",
      "and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort\n",
      "in London, and eager as she had long been to quit it,\n",
      "could not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to\n",
      "the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed\n",
      "those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby,\n",
      "which were now extinguished for ever, without great pain.\n",
      "Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained,\n",
      "busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE\n",
      "could have no share, without shedding many tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal,\n",
      "was more positive.  She had no such object for her lingering\n",
      "thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom\n",
      "it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever,\n",
      "she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution\n",

      "of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring\n",
      "Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their journey was safely performed.  The second\n",
      "day brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited,\n",
      "county of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns\n",
      "in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of the third\n",
      "they drove up to Cleveland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house,\n",
      "situated on a sloping lawn.  It had no park, but the\n",
      "pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like\n",
      "every other place of the same degree of importance,\n",
      "it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk,\n",
      "a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation,\n",
      "led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber,\n",
      "the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir,\n",
      "the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of\n",
      "them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,\n",
      "shut out the offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling\n",
      "with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty\n",
      "miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna;\n",
      "and before she had been five minutes within its walls,\n",
      "while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show\n",
      "her child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again,\n",
      "stealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just\n",
      "beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence;\n",
      "where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over\n",
      "a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly\n",
      "rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon,\n",
      "and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such moments of precious, invaluable misery,\n",
      "she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland;\n",
      "and as she returned by a different circuit to the house,\n",
      "feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty,\n",
      "of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude,\n",
      "she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day\n",
      "while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of\n",
      "such solitary rambles.\n",
      "\n",
      "She returned just in time to join the others\n",
      "as they quitted the house, on an excursion through its\n",
      "more immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was\n",
      "easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden,\n",
      "examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the\n",
      "gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through\n",
      "the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants,\n",
      "unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost,\n",
      "raised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her\n",
      "poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her\n",
      "dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being\n",
      "stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising\n",
      "young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne,\n",
      "in her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated\n",
      "for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland.\n",
      "With great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented\n",
      "by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.\n",
      "She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple,\n",
      "and perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely\n",
      "cold or damp would not have deterred her from it;\n",
      "but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry\n",
      "or pleasant weather for walking.\n",

      "Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work;\n",
      "they talked of the friends they had left behind,\n",
      "arranged Lady Middleton's engagements, and wondered\n",
      "whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\n",
      "than Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned\n",
      "in it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had\n",
      "the knack of finding her way in every house to the library,\n",
      "however it might be avoided by the family in general,\n",
      "soon procured herself a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant\n",
      "and friendly good humour could do, to make them feel\n",
      "themselves welcome.  The openness and heartiness of her\n",
      "manner more than atoned for that want of recollection\n",
      "and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms\n",
      "of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty\n",
      "a face, was engaging; her folly, though evident\n",
      "was not disgusting, because it was not conceited;\n",
      "and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very\n",
      "late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party,\n",
      "and a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a\n",
      "long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that\n",
      "little had seen so much variety in his address to her\n",
      "sister and herself, that she knew not what to expect\n",
      "to find him in his own family.  She found him, however,\n",
      "perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\n",
      "and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother;\n",
      "she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion,\n",
      "and only prevented from being so always, by too great\n",
      "an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people\n",
      "in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "and Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits,\n",
      "they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive,\n",
      "with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life.\n",
      "He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours;\n",
      "fond of his child, though affecting to slight it;\n",
      "and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought\n",
      "to have been devoted to business.  She liked him, however,\n",
      "upon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in\n",
      "her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--\n",
      "not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism,\n",
      "his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency\n",
      "on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple taste,\n",
      "and diffident feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns,\n",
      "she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who,\n",
      "treating her at once as the disinterested friend\n",
      "of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,\n",
      "talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford,\n",
      "described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant\n",
      "to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour\n",
      "to her in this, as well as in every other particular,\n",
      "his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence\n",
      "of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,\n",
      "and his deference for her opinion, might very well\n",
      "justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,\n",
      "and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still,\n",
      "as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite,\n",
      "to make her suspect it herself.  But as it was,\n",
      "such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head,\n",
      "except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could\n",
      "not help believing herself the nicest observer of the\n",
      "two;--she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought\n",
      "only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious\n",
      "solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and throat,\n",
      "the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,\n",
      "entirely escaped the latter lady's observation;--SHE could\n",
      "discover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm\n",
      "of a lover.\n",

      "Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth\n",

      "in the most distant parts of them, where there was something\n",
      "more of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were\n",
      "the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\n",
      "had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting\n",
      "in her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold\n",
      "so violent as, though for a day or two trifled with\n",
      "or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on\n",
      "the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\n",
      "Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual,\n",
      "were all declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain\n",
      "in her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night's\n",
      "rest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty\n",

      "Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time;\n",
      "to every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to\n",
      "prove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments.\n",
      "But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire\n",
      "with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,\n",
      "or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak\n",
      "much in favour of her amendment; and when, at last,\n",
      "she went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel\n",
      "Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure,\n",
      "who, though attending and nursing her the whole day,\n",
      "against Marianne inclination, and forcing proper medicines\n",
      "on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty\n",
      "and efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very restless and feverish night, however,\n",
      "disappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne,\n",
      "after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable\n",
      "to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed,\n",
      "Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice,\n",
      "of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging\n",
      "Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore\n",
      "her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder\n",
      "to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word \"infection\"\n",
      "to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,\n",
      "on her baby's account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\n",
      "from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious\n",
      "than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report,\n",
      "and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the\n",
      "necessity of her immediate removal with her infant;\n",
      "and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,\n",
      "found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great\n",
      "to be withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;\n",
      "and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off,\n",
      "with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a\n",
      "near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles\n",
      "on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised,\n",
      "at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two;\n",
      "and whither she was almost equally urgent with her\n",
      "mother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings, however, with a\n",
      "kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,\n",
      "declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland\n",
      "as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,\n",
      "by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place\n",
      "of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her\n",
      "on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,\n",
      "desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her\n",
      "better experience in nursing, of material use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature\n",
      "of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,\n",
      "could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;\n",
      "and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,\n",
      "but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;\n",
      "for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;\n",
      "and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "were to have taken their mother by surprise on the\n",
      "following forenoon.  The little she said was all in\n",
      "lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried\n",
      "to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN\n",
      "really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day produced little or no alteration in the\n",
      "state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,\n",
      "except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.\n",
      "Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,\n",
      "though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\n",
      "and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be\n",
      "frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last\n",
      "by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;\n",
      "and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,\n",
      "with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\n",
      "likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away\n",
      "while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's\n",
      "account, would be to deprive them both, she thought,\n",
      "of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once\n",
      "that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,\n",
      "that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,\n",
      "while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she\n",
      "urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying\n",
      "the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\n",
      "long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed\n",
      "to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person\n",
      "so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all\n",
      "these arrangements.  She knew not that she had been\n",
      "the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,\n",
      "in about seven days from the time of their arrival.\n",
      "It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing\n",
      "of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern,\n",
      "she never mentioned her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure,\n",
      "and her situation continued, with little variation,\n",
      "the same.  Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,\n",
      "still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood\n",
      "was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\n",
      "was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined\n",
      "very early in the seizure that Marianne would never\n",
      "get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly\n",
      "of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings,\n",
      "was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.\n",
      "He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different\n",
      "judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;\n",
      "but the many hours of each day in which he was left\n",
      "entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission\n",
      "of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from\n",
      "his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy\n",
      "anticipations of both were almost done away; for when\n",
      "Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.\n",
      "Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable\n",
      "than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed in every\n",
      "pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that\n",
      "in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own\n",
      "judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light\n",
      "of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;\n",
      "and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be\n",
      "able to travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--\n",
      "Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing\n",
      "more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.\n",
      "Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to\n",
      "attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue\n",
      "of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully\n",
      "administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with\n",
      "satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which\n",
      "she expected the most beneficial effects.  Her sleep,\n",
      "though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,\n",
      "lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe\n",
      "the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her\n",
      "during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing\n",
      "of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;\n",
      "her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\n",
      "herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained\n",
      "alone with Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed;\n",
      "and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention\n",
      "her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent\n",
      "but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,\n",
      "was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,\n",
      "when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise\n",
      "in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,\n",
      "cried out,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is mama coming?--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror,\n",
      "and assisting Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will\n",
      "be here, I hope, before it is long.  It is a great way,\n",
      "you know, from hence to Barton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne,\n",
      "in the same hurried manner.  \"I shall never see her,\n",
      "if she goes by London.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not\n",
      "quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,\n",
      "eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and quicker than ever!\n",
      "and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm\n",
      "increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending\n",
      "instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger\n",
      "to Barton for her mother.  To consult with Colonel Brandon\n",
      "on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought\n",
      "which immediately followed the resolution of its performance;\n",
      "and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place\n",
      "by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,\n",
      "where she knew he was generally to be found at a much\n",
      "later hour than the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her\n",
      "difficulties were immediately before him.  Her fears,\n",
      "he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--\n",
      "he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her\n",
      "difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness\n",
      "that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service\n",
      "pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the\n",
      "messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.  Elinor made no\n",
      "resistance that was not easily overcome.  She thanked him\n",
      "with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went\n",
      "to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and\n",
      "an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines\n",
      "to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel\n",
      "Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully\n",
      "was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,\n",
      "whose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might\n",
      "soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD\n",
      "be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,\n",
      "would lessen it.\n",
      "\n",
      "HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all\n",
      "the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary\n",
      "arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated\n",
      "with exactness the time in which she might look for\n",
      "his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.\n",
      "The horses arrived, even before they were expected,\n",
      "and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look\n",
      "of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,\n",
      "hurried into the carriage.  It was then about twelve\n",
      "o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait\n",
      "for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her\n",
      "the rest of the night.  It was a night of almost equal\n",
      "suffering to both.  Hour after hour passed away in sleepless\n",
      "pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most\n",
      "cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.\n",
      "Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all\n",
      "her former security; and the servant who sat up with her,\n",
      "for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,\n",
      "only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress\n",
      "had always thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals,\n",
      "fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she\n",
      "mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of\n",
      "poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled\n",
      "with so many days of illness, and wretched for some\n",
      "immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon\n",
      "be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,\n",
      "and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving\n",
      "too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris,\n",
      "or if HE could not come, for some other advice,\n",
      "when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived.\n",
      "His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,\n",
      "for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\n",
      "alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger\n",
      "to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh\n",
      "mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,\n",
      "in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.  He promised\n",
      "to call again in the course of three or four hours,\n",
      "and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\n",
      "composed than he had found them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not\n",
      "being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the\n",
      "morning of what had passed.  Her former apprehensions,\n",
      "now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of\n",
      "the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\n",
      "her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her\n",
      "to offer the comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.\n",
      "The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,\n",
      "so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested\n",
      "person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassion\n",
      "she had other claims.  She had been for three months\n",
      "her companion, was still under her care, and she was\n",
      "known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.\n",
      "The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,\n",
      "was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what\n",
      "Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings\n",
      "was very sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--\n",
      "but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the\n",
      "last would produce.  His medicines had failed;--the fever\n",
      "was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more\n",
      "herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching all,\n",
      "and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call\n",
      "in further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had\n",
      "still something more to try, some more fresh application,\n",
      "of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his\n",
      "visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\n",
      "the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.\n",
      "She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\n",
      "but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued\n",
      "till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed,\n",
      "her thoughts wandering from one image of grief,\n",
      "one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed\n",
      "to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger\n",
      "of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition\n",
      "which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.\n",
      "Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it\n",
      "gave fresh misery to her reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a\n",
      "dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,\n",
      "even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive\n",
      "a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited,\n",
      "watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,\n",
      "with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,\n",
      "than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate\n",
      "her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,\n",
      "to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her\n",
      "young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--\n",
      "and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,\n",
      "told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.\n",
      "Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,\n",
      "she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.\n",
      "Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom\n",
      "yet blessed her.  Others even arose to confirm it.\n",
      "Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor\n",
      "with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on\n",
      "her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and\n",
      "hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no\n",
      "moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at\n",
      "four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on\n",
      "a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,\n",
      "gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was in every respect materially better,\n",
      "and he declared her entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her\n",
      "forebodings which had been found in their late alarm,\n",
      "allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\n",
      "with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,\n",
      "the probability of an entire recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a\n",
      "different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.\n",
      "Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her\n",
      "doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations\n",
      "of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--\n",
      "but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\n",
      "no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction,\n",
      "silent and strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued by the side of her sister, with little\n",
      "intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,\n",
      "satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,\n",
      "supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and\n",
      "every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,\n",
      "in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--\n",
      "but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,\n",
      "that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne\n",
      "at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all\n",
      "appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon\n",
      "might be expected back.  At ten o'clock, she trusted,\n",
      "or at least not much later her mother would be relieved\n",
      "from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be\n",
      "travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\n",
      "less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress\n",
      "of time which yet kept them in ignorance!\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep,\n",
      "she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.\n",
      "Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of\n",
      "dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--\n",
      "and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings\n",
      "of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,\n",
      "to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to\n",
      "take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,\n",
      "no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was\n",
      "not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the\n",
      "sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\n",
      "left her there again to her charge and her thoughts,\n",
      "and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared\n",
      "round the house, and the rain beat against the windows;\n",
      "but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.\n",
      "Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--\n",
      "they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten,\n",
      "Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment\n",
      "she heard a carriage driving up to the house;\n",
      "and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite\n",
      "of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,\n",
      "that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and\n",
      "opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.\n",
      "She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.\n",
      "The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.\n",
      "By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it\n",
      "to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the\n",
      "excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation\n",
      "to such unexpected rapidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult\n",
      "to be calm, as at that moment.  The knowledge of what her\n",
      "mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--\n",
      "of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and\n",
      "of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was\n",
      "impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done\n",
      "was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till\n",
      "she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister,\n",
      "she hurried down stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along\n",
      "an inner lobby, assured her that they were already\n",
      "in the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she\n",
      "entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at\n",
      "the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart\n",
      "in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand\n",
      "was already on the lock, when its action was suspended\n",
      "by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather\n",
      "of command than supplication,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--\n",
      "I entreat you to stay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall NOT stay.\n",
      "Your business cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose,\n",
      "forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence,\n",
      "\"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,\n",
      "it would not have turned me from the door.  My business\n",
      "is with you, and only you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement--\"well, sir,--\n",
      "be quick--and if you can--less violent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility\n",
      "of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there,\n",
      "came across her.  But she had promised to hear him,\n",
      "and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.\n",
      "After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that\n",
      "prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would\n",
      "best promote it, she walked silently towards the table,\n",
      "and sat down.  He took the opposite chair, and for half\n",
      "a minute not a word was said by either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray be quick, sir,\"--said Elinor, impatiently;--\n",
      "\"I have no time to spare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,\n",
      "and seemed not to hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment\n",
      "afterwards--\"is out of danger.  I heard it from the servant.\n",
      "God be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with\n",
      "yet greater eagerness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We hope she is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose up, and walked across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But\n",
      "since I AM here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he\n",
      "returned to his seat--\"what does it signify?--For once,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us\n",
      "be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--\n",
      "Tell me honestly\"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--\n",
      "\"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.\n",
      "She began to think that be must be in liquor;--the\n",
      "strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,\n",
      "seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression\n",
      "she immediately rose, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return\n",
      "to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--\n",
      "Whatever your business may be with me, will it be better\n",
      "recollected and explained to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile,\n",
      "and a voice perfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk.--\n",
      "A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was\n",
      "enough to over-set me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at\n",
      "a loss to understand what he would be at.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock,\n",
      "and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise\n",
      "since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence\n",
      "of his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever\n",
      "other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,\n",
      "he was not brought there by intoxication, she said,\n",
      "after a moment's recollection,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly\n",
      "DO--that after what has passed--your coming here in\n",
      "this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,\n",
      "requires a very particular excuse.--What is it,\n",
      "that you mean by it?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can,\n",
      "to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.\n",
      "I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind\n",
      "of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,\n",
      "and by convincing you, that though I have been always\n",
      "a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain\n",
      "something like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer, with a warmth\n",
      "which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance,\n",
      "and in spite of herself made her think him sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--\n",
      "for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has she?\"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--\n",
      "\"Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.\n",
      "But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable\n",
      "grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor bowed her assent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation\n",
      "on her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how YOU\n",
      "may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,\n",
      "or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--\n",
      "Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\n",
      "worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.\n",
      "When I first became intimate in your family, I had no\n",
      "other intention, no other view in the acquaintance\n",
      "than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain\n",
      "in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.\n",
      "Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners\n",
      "could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost\n",
      "from the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing,\n",
      "when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my\n",
      "heart should have been so insensible!  But at first\n",
      "I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.\n",
      "Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,\n",
      "giving way to feelings which I had always been too much\n",
      "in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means\n",
      "in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\n",
      "design of returning her affection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him\n",
      "with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,\n",
      "for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.\n",
      "Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--\n",
      "Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on\n",
      "the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied,\n",
      "\"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,\n",
      "always in the habit of associating with people of better\n",
      "income than myself.  Every year since my coming of age,\n",
      "or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though\n",
      "the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;\n",
      "yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,\n",
      "it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my\n",
      "circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.  To attach\n",
      "myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be\n",
      "thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--\n",
      "which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting\n",
      "in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a\n",
      "thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said\n",
      "for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,\n",
      "I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,\n",
      "because I did not THEN know what it was to love.\n",
      "But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I\n",
      "really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,\n",
      "to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--\n",
      "But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,\n",
      "which her affection and her society would have deprived\n",
      "of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,\n",
      "lost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened,\n",
      "\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood\n",
      "such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have\n",
      "done it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,\n",
      "sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life\n",
      "were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions\n",
      "were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.\n",
      "Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying\n",
      "my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly\n",
      "to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\n",
      "from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement\n",
      "while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.\n",
      "I will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate\n",
      "on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling\n",
      "to engage my faith where my honour was already bound.\n",
      "The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,\n",
      "providing with great circumspection for a possible\n",
      "opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched\n",
      "for ever.  At last, however, my resolution was taken,\n",
      "and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,\n",
      "to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,\n",
      "and openly assure her of an affection which I had already\n",
      "taken such pains to display.  But in the interim--in the\n",
      "interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I\n",
      "could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--\n",
      "a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin\n",
      "all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery\n",
      "took place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs. Smith\n",
      "had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some\n",
      "distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of\n",
      "her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not\n",
      "explain myself farther,\" he added, looking at her with an\n",
      "heightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular\n",
      "intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise,\n",
      "and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,\n",
      "\"I have heard it all.  And how you will explain away any\n",
      "part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess\n",
      "is beyond my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received\n",
      "the account.  Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge\n",
      "that her situation and her character ought to have been\n",
      "respected by me.  I do not mean to justify myself, but at\n",
      "the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing\n",
      "to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\n",
      "and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.\n",
      "If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her\n",
      "understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.\n",
      "Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,\n",
      "with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,\n",
      "for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.\n",
      "I wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured\n",
      "more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection\n",
      "for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;\n",
      "and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate\n",
      "girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion\n",
      "of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no\n",
      "apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do not think yourself\n",
      "excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding\n",
      "on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\n",
      "You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself\n",
      "in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,\n",
      "always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\" he warmly\n",
      "replied; \"I did not recollect that I had omitted to give\n",
      "her my direction; and common sense might have told her\n",
      "how to find it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion\n",
      "may be guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality\n",
      "of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing\n",
      "was against me.  The matter itself I could not deny,\n",
      "and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was\n",
      "previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my\n",
      "conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with\n",
      "the very little attention, the very little portion of my\n",
      "time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.\n",
      "In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I\n",
      "might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality,\n",
      "good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would\n",
      "marry Eliza.  That could not be--and I was formally\n",
      "dismissed from her favour and her house.  The night\n",
      "following this affair--I was to go the next morning--\n",
      "was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct\n",
      "should be.  The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.\n",
      "My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her\n",

      "I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,\n",

      "some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking\n",
      "this engagement.  But whether I should write this apology,\n",
      "or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.\n",
      "To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted\n",
      "whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.\n",
      "In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,\n",

      "or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part\n",
      "of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--\n",
      "and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,\n",
      "in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,\n",

      "I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother\n",
      "to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.\n",
      "Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was miserable.\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\n",
      "gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge\n",
      "to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,\n",
      "that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and\n",
      "exultation to me now.  Well, I went, left all that I loved,\n",
      "and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.\n",

      "in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more\n",
      "simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--\n",
      "my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word\n",
      "was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,\n",
      "were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.\n",
      "To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--\n",
      "a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof\n",

      "in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy\n",
      "of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say awakened,\n",
      "because time and London, business and dissipation,\n",
      "had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing\n",
      "a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,\n",
      "and chusing to fancy that she too must have become\n",
      "indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment\n",
      "as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders\n",
      "in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\n",
      "overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,\n",
      "'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'--\n",

      "But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey\n",

      "as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did in Bond Street,\n",
      "there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse\n",

      "watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing\n",
      "desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us\n",
      "so long.  I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,\n",

      "an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being\n",
      "in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,\n",

      "The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--\n",
      "still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything\n",
      "that could make MY conduct most hateful.  I could not\n",

      "Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me\n",
      "Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand\n",
      "to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching\n",

      "Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;\n",

      "as death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--\n",
      "the last manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid\n",
      "sight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying,\n",
      "it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew\n",
      "exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last\n",
      "in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me,\n",
      "as I travelled, in the same look and hue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.\n",

      "You saw what she said.  I was breakfasting at the\n",
      "Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought\n",
      "to me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch\n",
      "Sophia's eye before it caught mine--and its size,\n",
      "the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,\n",
      "immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague report had\n",
      "reached her before of my attachment to some young lady\n",
      "in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation\n",
      "the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,\n",
      "and made her more jealous than ever.  Affecting that air\n",
      "of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman\n",
      "one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read\n",
      "its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.\n",
      "She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could\n",
      "have borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it\n",
      "must be appeased.  And, in short--what do you think of my\n",
      "wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--\n",
      "truly feminine--was it not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying\n",
      "such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.\n",
      "The original was all her own--her own happy thoughts\n",
      "and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were engaged,\n",
      "every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am\n",
      "talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words,\n",
      "her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like\n",
      "mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.\n",
      "And after all, what did it signify to my character\n",
      "in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language\n",
      "my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.\n",
      "My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether\n",
      "I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--\n",

      "myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society,\n",
      "they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter\n",
      "will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were\n",
      "my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,\n",
      "I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics\n",
      "of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily they were all\n",
      "in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence,\n",
      "and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up,\n",
      "and could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too\n",
      "I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,\n",
      "which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating\n",

      "Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time\n",
      "even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained\n",
      "too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in\n",
      "themselves, but of which sadness was the general result,\n",
      "to think even of her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had\n",
      "abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite\n",
      "of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration\n",
      "for the sufferings produced by them, which made her\n",
      "think of him as now separated for ever from her family,\n",
      "with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she\n",
      "soon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to\n",
      "his merits.  She felt that his influence over her mind\n",
      "was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason\n",
      "to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\n",
      "that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it\n",
      "was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love\n",
      "for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.\n",
      "But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could\n",
      "feel his influence less.\n",
      "\n",
      "When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne,\n",
      "she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet\n",
      "a sleep to the extent of her hopes.  Elinor's heart was full.\n",
      "The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit,\n",
      "Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival,\n",
      "threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits\n",
      "which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made\n",
      "her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.\n",
      "Short was the time, however, in which that fear could\n",
      "affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's\n",
      "leaving the house, she was again called down stairs\n",
      "by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her\n",
      "mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense,\n",
      "she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward\n",
      "door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the\n",
      "house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's\n",
      "being no more, had no voice to inquire after her,\n",
      "no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for\n",
      "salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--\n",
      "and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,\n",
      "was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she\n",
      "had been before by her fears.  She was supported into\n",
      "the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--\n",
      "and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\n",
      "to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her\n",
      "at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look\n",
      "which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction\n",
      "of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.\n",
      "He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself,\n",
      "to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she\n",
      "was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever\n",
      "by absence, unhappiness, and danger.  Elinor's delight,\n",
      "as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked\n",
      "by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--\n",
      "but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,\n",
      "when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne,\n",
      "satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious\n",
      "of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the\n",
      "silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,\n",
      "in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed.\n",
      "But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,\n",
      "and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to\n",
      "make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.\n",
      "Willoughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now allowed\n",
      "herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she\n",
      "would not but have heard his vindication for the world,\n",
      "and now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him\n",
      "so harshly before.  But her promise of relating it to her\n",
      "sister was invariably painful.  She dreaded the performance\n",
      "of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be;\n",
      "doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever\n",
      "be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby\n",
      "a widower.  Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,\n",
      "felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more\n",
      "than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due,\n",
      "and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been\n",
      "much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;\n",
      "for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she\n",
      "had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that\n",
      "very day, without waiting for any further intelligence,\n",
      "and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\n",
      "that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch\n",
      "Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her\n",
      "where there might be infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant\n",
      "cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved\n",
      "her to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of\n",
      "the happiest women in the world.  Elinor could not hear\n",
      "the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes\n",
      "wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.\n",
      "But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account\n",
      "of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,\n",
      "was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only\n",
      "of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her\n",
      "from a danger in which, as she now began to feel,\n",
      "her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\n",
      "attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--\n",
      "and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy\n",
      "unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her,\n",
      "as soon as any opportunity of private conference\n",
      "between them occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet\n",

      "\n",
      "Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained,\n",
      "surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should\n",
      "wonder at your composure now.  Had I sat down to wish\n",
      "for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed\n",
      "on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as the object\n",
      "most desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the most\n",
      "happy with him of the two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so,\n",
      "because satisfied that none founded on an impartial\n",
      "consideration of their age, characters, or feelings,\n",
      "could be given;--but her mother must always be carried\n",
      "away by her imagination on any interesting subject,\n",

      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.\n",
      "It came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may\n",
      "well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could\n",
      "not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own,\n",
      "and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world\n",
      "now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,\n",
      "not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible\n",
      "feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant,\n",
      "affection for Marianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since\n",
      "the first moment of seeing her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language,\n",
      "not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural\n",
      "embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned\n",
      "every thing delightful to her as it chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything\n",
      "that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm,\n",
      "as more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--\n",
      "has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's\n",
      "unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and\n",
      "without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could\n",
      "he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--\n",

      "after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage\n",
      "such affection, or even to be pleased by it.  But his coming\n",
      "for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,\n",
      "is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest\n",
      "on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,\n",
      "were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.\n",
      "To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long\n",
      "and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;\n",
      "and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,\n",
      "is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,\n",
      "that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready\n",
      "as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing\n",
      "to us in the world.  What answer did you give him?--Did you\n",
      "allow him to hope?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him\n",
      "or to myself.  Marianne might at that moment be dying.\n",
      "But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  His was\n",
      "an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion\n",
      "to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.\n",
      "Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite\n",
      "overcome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might,\n",
      "my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;\n",
      "and since our arrival, since our delightful security,\n",
      "I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\n",
      "encouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time,\n",
      "I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is\n",
      "not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.--\n",
      "His own merits must soon secure it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however,\n",
      "you have not yet made him equally sanguine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.--He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply\n",
      "rooted for any change in it under a great length of time,\n",
      "and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident\n",
      "of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age\n",
      "and disposition he could ever attach her.  There, however,\n",
      "he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond\n",
      "hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and\n",
      "principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,\n",
      "is exactly the very one to make your sister happy.\n",
      "And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.\n",
      "My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not\n",
      "so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,\n",
      "there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--\n",
      "There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's\n",
      "eyes at times, which I did not like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And his manners, the Colonel's manners are not only\n",
      "more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they\n",
      "are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching\n",
      "to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine attention\n",
      "to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity\n",
      "is much more accordant with her real disposition, than\n",
      "the liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed\n",
      "of the other.  I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby\n",
      "turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself\n",
      "the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy\n",
      "with HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree\n",
      "with her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore\n",
      "gave no offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\"\n",
      "added Mrs. Dashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all\n",
      "probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there\n",
      "certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by,\n",
      "that would suit us quite as well as our present situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting\n",

      "\"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know,\n",
      "everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know\n",
      "nor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be\n",
      "a good one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a\n",
      "third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over\n",
      "in private, to wish success to her friend, and yet\n",
      "in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\n",

      "had not been long enough to make her recovery slow;\n",

      "in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,\n",
      "within four days after the arrival of the latter,\n",
      "into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room.  When there, at her own\n",
      "particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth\n",

      "His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered\n",
      "looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately\n",

      "must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,\n",
      "or the consciousness of its being known to others;\n",
      "and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than\n",
      "her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,\n",
      "and therefore watching to very different effect,\n",
      "saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose\n",

      "urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes,\n",
      "began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER measures\n",
      "depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could\n",
      "not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel\n",
      "Brandon was soon brought, by their united request,\n",
      "to consider his own abode there as equally determinate,\n",

      "and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned\n",
      "to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\n",
      "for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon\n",
      "immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.\n",
      "\n",

      "Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most\n",

      "was the office of each watchful companion, and each\n",
      "found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness\n",
      "of spirits.  To Elinor, the observation of the latter\n",
      "was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen her week\n",
      "after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish\n",
      "of heart which she had neither courage to speak of,\n",
      "nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other\n",
      "could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,\n",
      "in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,\n",
      "must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered\n",
      "on scenes of which every field and every tree brought\n",
      "some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent\n",
      "and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,\n",
      "sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here,\n",
      "Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,\n",
      "as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she\n",
      "had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural\n",
      "in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,\n",
      "and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the\n",
      "whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction\n",
      "of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner\n",
      "had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne\n",
      "turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,\n",
      "as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight\n",
      "of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\n",
      "be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed\n",
      "at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,\n",
      "it never passed away without the atonement of a smile.\n",
      "After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;\n",
      "but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,\n",
      "procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\n",
      "favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\n",
      "in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,\n",
      "put the music aside, and after running over the keys\n",
      "for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,\n",
      "and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness\n",
      "as she did so, that she should in future practice much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning produced no abatement in these\n",
      "happy symptoms.  On the contrary, with a mind and body\n",
      "alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with\n",
      "more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\n",
      "Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party\n",
      "which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits\n",
      "and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered\n",
      "my strength,\" said she, \"we will take long walks together\n",
      "every day.  We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,\n",
      "and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's\n",
      "new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\n",
      "and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,\n",
      "and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told\n",
      "they once reached.  I know we shall be happy.  I know\n",
      "the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to be\n",
      "later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner\n",
      "I shall divide every moment between music and reading.\n",
      "I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course\n",
      "of serious study.  Our own library is too well known to me,\n",

      "in the lane before the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness\n",
      "of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her\n",

      "beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill,\n",
      "the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes\n",
      "turned towards it, Marianne calmly said,\n",

      "\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand,\n",
      "\"on that projecting mound,--there I fell; and there\n",

      "are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,\n",
      "if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS\n",
      "acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,\n",
      "if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked\n",

      "been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must\n",
      "it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,\n",

      "\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne\n",

      "\"They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not,\n",
      "my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know\n",
      "your judgment must censure.  My illness has made me think--\n",
      "It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.\n",
      "Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly\n",
      "able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my\n",
      "own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance\n",
      "with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence\n",
      "towards myself, and want of kindness to others.\n",
      "I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,\n",
      "and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led\n",
      "me to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been\n",
      "entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my\n",
      "own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.\n",
      "Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I\n",
      "did not know my danger till the danger was removed;\n",
      "but with such feelings as these reflections gave me,\n",
      "I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness\n",
      "of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,\n",
      "and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I died,--\n",
      "in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,\n",
      "my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful\n",
      "selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the\n",
      "murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR\n",
      "remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have consoled\n",
      "her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.\n",
      "Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected,\n",
      "or some failing indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.\n",
      "The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  To the Middletons,\n",
      "to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,\n",
      "I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened\n",
      "against their merits, and a temper irritated by their\n",
      "very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,\n",
      "little as they deserve, I had given less than their due.\n",
      "But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged\n",
      "by me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;\n",
      "yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion\n",
      "that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was\n",
      "before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate\n",
      "of you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your forbearance,\n",
      "or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those\n",
      "offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude\n",
      "which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--\n",
      "not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I\n",
      "had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every\n",
      "exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow\n",
      "to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart\n",
      "which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you,\n",

      "to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.\n",
      "They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.\n",
      "I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my mother,\n",

      "you will share my affections entirely between you.\n",
      ">From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest\n",
      "incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society,\n",
      "it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled,\n",
      "my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities,\n",
      "the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.\n",
      "As for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall\n",
      "ever forget him, would be idle.  His remembrance can be overcome\n",
      "by no change of circumstances or opinions.  But it shall\n",
      "be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,\n",
      "by constant employment.\"\n",

      "on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding\n",
      "her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than\n",
      "at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection\n",

      "leading to the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address;\n",
      "prepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply\n",

      "grounded his apology; did justice to his repentance,\n",
      "and softened only his protestations of present regard.\n",
      "Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes\n",

      "than even sickness had left them.  A thousand inquiries\n",
      "sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.\n",
      "She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\n",

      "tears covered her cheeks.\n",

      "easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be\n",
      "though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of\n",
      "nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together;\n",
      "and was carefully minute in every particular of speech\n",

      "As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss\n",
      "of gratitude and these two words just articulate through\n",
      "her tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister and\n",

      "to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;\n",
      "and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,\n",
      "and a resolution of reviving the subject again,\n",

      "of her former favourite.  She rejoiced in his being\n",
      "cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was\n",
      "sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the feelings\n",
      "of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore\n",

      "and been under the influence of his countenance and his\n",
      "manner, it is probable that her compassion would have\n",
      "been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor's power,\n",
      "nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her\n",
      "retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth\n",
      "in herself.  Reflection had given calmness to her judgment,\n",
      "and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby's deserts;--\n",
      "she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,\n",
      "and lay open such facts as were really due to his character,\n",
      "without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the\n",
      "fancy astray.\n",

      "In the evening, when they were all three together,\n",
      "Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--\n",

      "unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time\n",

      "with soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished\n",

      "\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told\n",
      "me this morning--I have now heard exactly what I\n",
      "wished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice was lost;\n",
      "but recovering herself, she added, and with greater\n",
      "calmness than before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied,\n",
      "I wish for no change.  I never could have been happy\n",
      "with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must\n",
      "have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence,\n",

      "\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as\n",
      "a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;\n",
      "and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only\n",
      "in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough\n",
      "to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you\n",
      "in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which\n",
      "you would have been poorly supported by an affection,\n",
      "on his side, much less certain.  Had you married,\n",
      "you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is\n",
      "acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares\n",
      "that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.\n",
      "His demands and your inexperience together, on a small,\n",
      "very small income, must have brought on distresses which\n",
      "would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been\n",
      "entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense\n",
      "of honour and honesty would have led you, I know,\n",
      "when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy\n",
      "that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long\n",
      "as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,\n",
      "you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--\n",
      "and how little could the utmost of your single management\n",
      "do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--\n",
      "Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,\n",
      "to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead\n",
      "of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,\n",
      "you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,\n",

      "in such difficulties?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word\n",
      "\"Selfish?\" in a tone that implied--\"do you really think\n",
      "him selfish?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor,\n",
      "\"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been\n",
      "grounded on selfishness.  It was selfishness which first\n",
      "made him sport with your affections; which afterwards,\n",
      "when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\n",
      "of it, and which finally carried him from Barton.\n",
      "His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,\n",
      "his ruling principle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he\n",
      "has done.  And why does he regret it?--Because he finds\n",
      "it has not answered towards himself.  It has not made\n",
      "him happy.  His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he\n",
      "suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\n",
      "that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper\n",
      "than yourself.  But does it follow that had he married you,\n",
      "he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have\n",
      "been different.  He would then have suffered under the\n",
      "pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,\n",
      "he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife\n",
      "of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would\n",
      "have been always necessitous--always poor; and probably\n",
      "would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts\n",
      "of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,\n",
      "even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Dashwood; \"SHE must be answerable.\"\n",

      "Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,\n",
      "satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid\n",
      "any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's\n",
      "spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,\n",
      "immediately continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from\n",
      "the whole of the story--that all Willoughby's difficulties\n",
      "have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his\n",
      "behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime has been the origin\n",
      "of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark;\n",
      "and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship\n",
      "and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did\n",
      "not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two\n",
      "or three following days, that Marianne did not continue\n",
      "to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution\n",
      "was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful\n",
      "and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect\n",
      "of time upon her health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret returned, and the family were again all\n",
      "restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;\n",

      "so much vigour as when they first came to Barton,\n",
      "at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\n",

      "She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,\n",
      "nothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his\n",
      "present abode.  Some letters had passed between her\n",
      "and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness;\n",
      "and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--\n",
      "\"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no\n",
      "enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him\n",
      "to be still at Oxford;\" which was all the intelligence\n",
      "of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name\n",
      "was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\n",
      "She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of\n",
      "his measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter\n",
      "on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had\n",

      "of his errand, this was his voluntary communication--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"\n",

      "Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes\n",

      "and was not only in the rapturous profession of\n",
      "the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,\n",
      "one of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was\n",

      "to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.  I felt\n",
      "that I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship;\n",

      "garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of\n",
      "the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself,\n",

      "to live upon.  Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor\n",
      "one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could\n",
      "call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "should advance anything; and they were neither of them\n",
      "quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty\n",
      "pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.\n",

      "favourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT\n",
      "he rested for the residue of their income.  But Elinor\n",
      "had no such dependence; for since Edward would still\n",

      "had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language\n",
      "as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,\n",

      "since her living at Barton, more company with her than\n",
      "her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the\n",
      "privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore\n",
      "walked every night to his old quarters at the Park;\n",
      "from whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough\n",

      "and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\n",

      "all the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement\n",
      "of her mother's language, to make it cheerful.\n",
      "Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.\n",
      "No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\n",
      "nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his\n",
      "visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.\n",
      "Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,\n",

      "It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced\n",

      "in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\n",

      "\n",
      "The letters from town, which a few days before would\n",

      "honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth\n",
      "her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure,\n",
      "had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,\n",
      "by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.--\n",
      "\"I do think,\" she continued, \"nothing was ever carried\n",
      "on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called\n",
      "and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul suspected\n",
      "anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!\n",
      "came crying to me the day after, in a great fright\n",
      "for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to\n",
      "get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her\n",
      "money before she went off to be married, on purpose\n",
      "we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not\n",
      "seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give\n",
      "her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she\n",
      "thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess,\n",
      "in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.\n",
      "And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them\n",
      "along with them in the chaise is worse than all.\n",
      "Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but you\n",
      "must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to\n",
      "comfort him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women--poor\n",
      "Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he\n",
      "considered the existence of each, under such a blow,\n",
      "with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unpardonable,\n",
      "but Lucy's was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were\n",
      "ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,\n",
      "if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,\n",
      "his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,\n",
      "nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy\n",
      "with which everything had been carried on between them,\n",
      "was rationally treated as enormously heightening\n",
      "the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred\n",
      "to the others, proper measures would have been taken\n",
      "to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join\n",
      "with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward\n",
      "had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus\n",
      "be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--\n",
      "He thus continued:\n",

      "not a line has been received from him on the occasion.\n",
      "Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,\n",
      "and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line\n",
      "to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter\n",
      "of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny,\n",
      "and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;\n",
      "for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart,\n",

      "\n",
      "This paragraph was of some importance to the\n",

      "make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor\n",
      "penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy;\n",

      "\n",
      "He had nothing to urge against it, but still\n",

      "and therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared\n",
      "a much greater willingness to make mean concessions\n",
      "by word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,\n",

      "might have some personal knowledge of his future home,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars,\n",
      "just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that\n",
      "reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring,\n",
      "the reproach of being too amiable, Edward was admitted\n",
      "to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.\n",
      "For many years of her life she had had two sons;\n",
      "but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago,\n",
      "had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert\n",
      "had left her for a fortnight without any; and now,\n",
      "by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of his being allowed once more to live,\n",
      "however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence\n",
      "secure, till he had revealed his present engagement;\n",
      "for the publication of that circumstance, he feared,\n",
      "might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry\n",
      "him off as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution\n",
      "therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with\n",
      "unexpected calmness.  Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably\n",
      "endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton\n",
      "he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--\n",
      "and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton\n",
      "was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,\n",
      "while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private\n",
      "gentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that,\n",
      "though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,\n",
      "he was by no means inclined to be guided by it,\n",
      "she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,\n",
      "to submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay\n",
      "as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent\n",
      "every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree\n",
      "of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "What she would engage to do towards augmenting\n",
      "their income was next to be considered; and here it\n",
      "plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,\n",
      "he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\n",
      "inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,\n",
      "not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking\n",
      "orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;\n",
      "nor was anything promised either for the present or in future,\n",
      "beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as much, however, as was desired,\n",
      "and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor;\n",
      "and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\n",
      "seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n",
      "\n",
      "With an income quite sufficient to their wants\n",
      "thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for\n",
      "after Edward was in possession of the living, but the\n",
      "readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor,\n",
      "was making considerable improvements; and after waiting\n",
      "some time for their completion, after experiencing,\n",
      "as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays\n",
      "from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\n",
      "as usual, broke through the first positive resolution\n",
      "of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the\n",
      "ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first month after their marriage was spent\n",
      "with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence\n",
      "they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage,\n",
      "and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--\n",
      "could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together,\n",
      "were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward\n",
      "and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she\n",
      "found in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed,\n",
      "one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had\n",
      "in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for\n",
      "their cows.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were visited on their first settling by almost\n",
      "all their relations and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came\n",
      "to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed\n",
      "of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at\n",
      "the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\"\n",
      "said John, as they were walking together one morning before\n",
      "the gates of Delaford House, \"THAT would be saying too much,\n",
      "for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young\n",
      "women in the world, as it is.  But, I confess, it would\n",
      "give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother.\n",
      "His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\n",
      "such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I\n",
      "have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there\n",
      "is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps,\n",
      "Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--\n",
      "yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to\n",
      "have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\n",
      "Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what\n",
      "may happen--for, when people are much thrown together,\n",
      "and see little of anybody else--and it will always be\n",
      "in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--\n",
      "in short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand\n",
      "me.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always\n",
      "treated them with the make-believe of decent affection,\n",
      "they were never insulted by her real favour and preference.\n",
      "THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning\n",
      "of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months\n",
      "had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter,\n",
      "which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,\n",
      "was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;\n",
      "for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,\n",
      "and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening\n",
      "was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "to his choice, and re-established him completely in\n",
      "her favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair,\n",
      "and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held\n",
      "forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,\n",
      "an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress\n",
      "may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\n",
      "advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\n",
      "and conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance,\n",
      "and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings,\n",
      "it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.\n",
      "He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;\n",
      "and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\n",
      "of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews\n",
      "would settle the matter.  In that point, however,\n",
      "and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him\n",
      "hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,\n",
      "another visit, another conversation, was always wanted\n",
      "to produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered\n",
      "in her mind when they parted, which could only be\n",
      "removed by another half hour's discourse with himself.\n",
      "His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest\n",
      "followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward,\n",
      "they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject\n",
      "on which he had always more to say than on any other,\n",
      "and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal\n",
      "to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident\n",
      "to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.\n",
      "He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward,\n",
      "and very proud of marrying privately without his\n",
      "mother's consent.  What immediately followed is known.\n",
      "They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;\n",
      "for she had many relations and old acquaintances to\n",
      "cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--\n",
      "and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness\n",
      "of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,\n",
      "which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted.  The forgiveness,\n",
      "at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert;\n",
      "and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore\n",
      "could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\n",
      "longer unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct\n",
      "and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence,\n",
      "and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with,\n",
      "procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame\n",
      "her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid\n",
      "degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\n",
      "Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert\n",
      "or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven\n",
      "for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,\n",
      "though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken\n",
      "of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered,\n",
      "and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.\n",
      "They settled in town, received very liberal assistance\n",
      "from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable\n",
      "with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies\n",
      "and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,\n",
      "in which their husbands of course took a part, as well\n",
      "as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and\n",
      "Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which\n",
      "they all lived together.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest\n",
      "son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what\n",
      "Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them\n",
      "still more.  It was an arrangement, however, justified in\n",
      "its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever\n",
      "appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give\n",
      "a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income,\n",
      "as either leaving his brother too little, or bringing\n",
      "himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from\n",
      "the ready discharge of his duties in every particular,\n",
      "from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,\n",
      "and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,\n",
      "he might be supposed no less contented with his lot,\n",
      "no less free from every wish of an exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her\n",
      "family as could well be contrived, without rendering\n",
      "the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother\n",
      "and sisters spent much more than half their time with her.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\n",
      "as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford;\n",
      "for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together\n",
      "was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than\n",
      "what John had expressed.  It was now her darling object.\n",
      "Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,\n",
      "she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant\n",
      "enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at\n",
      "the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.\n",
      "They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations,\n",
      "and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward\n",
      "of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge\n",
      "so intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond\n",
      "attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it\n",
      "was observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she\n",
      "do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.\n",
      "She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,\n",
      "and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.\n",
      "She was born to overcome an affection formed so late\n",
      "in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\n",
      "superior to strong esteem and lively friendship,\n",
      "voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other,\n",
      "a man who had suffered no less than herself under the\n",
      "event of a former attachment, whom, two years before,\n",
      "she had considered too old to be married,--and who still\n",
      "sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\n",
      "\n",
      "But so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice\n",
      "to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly\n",
      "flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining\n",
      "even for ever with her mother, and finding her only\n",
      "pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her\n",
      "more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--\n",
      "she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,\n",
      "entering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,\n",
      "the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best\n",
      "loved him, believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he\n",
      "was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her\n",
      "society restored his mind to animation, and his spirits\n",
      "to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness\n",
      "in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight\n",
      "of each observing friend.  Marianne could never love\n",
      "by halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much\n",
      "devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without\n",
      "a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete\n",
      "in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating\n",
      "his marriage with a woman of character, as the source\n",
      "of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\n",
      "behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have\n",
      "been happy and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct,\n",
      "which thus brought its own punishment, was sincere,\n",
      "need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But that\n",
      "he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society,\n",
      "or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a\n",
      "broken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither.\n",
      "He lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.\n",
      "His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home\n",
      "always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\n",
      "and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable\n",
      "degree of domestic felicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility\n",
      "in surviving her loss--he always retained that decided\n",
      "regard which interested him in every thing that befell her,\n",
      "and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--\n",
      "and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in\n",
      "after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage,\n",
      "without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for\n",
      "Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them,\n",
      "Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing,\n",
      "and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant\n",
      "communication which strong family affection would\n",
      "naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness\n",
      "of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least\n",
